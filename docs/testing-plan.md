# Testing Plan for 2Truths-1Lie

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy, scope, tools, and schedule for the 2Truths-1Lie project. Comprehensive testing ensures a stable, performant, and user-friendly product aligned with our hackathon and production goals.

---

## 2. Testing Scope

- **Unit Testing:** Verify individual functions, components, and modules (game logic, UI components, API handlers).
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between components and backend systems (API endpoints, real-time updates).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate user workflows from challenge creation to guessing and scoring.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess responsiveness under load and concurrent user simulations.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Verify graceful degradation on failures (network loss, AI service downtime).

---

## 3. Test Environments and Tools

- **Environments:**
  - Local development with mocks and emulators
  - Staging server mirroring production setup for integrated testing
  - Production monitoring with analytics and error reporting

- **Tools:**
  - Jest for unit and integration tests
  - React Testing Library or equivalent for UI tests
  - Cypress or Playwright for E2E automation
  - Lighthouse and Axe for accessibility audits
  - Load testing tools like Artillery or JMeter
  - Sentry/Rollbar for runtime error tracking

---

## 4. Test Data and Fixtures

- Use synthetic and anonymized sample data to replicate real gameplay scenarios.
- Maintain test factories or fixture files to generate repeatable inputs.
- Mock external dependencies such as AffectLink API during automated tests.

---

## 5. Running Tests

- Include test scripts in `package.json` for easy command line execution:
  - `npm run test` for unit/integration tests
  - `npm run test:e2e` for end-to-end tests
  - `npm run test:lint` for linting and formatting checks

- Tests should be run:
  - Locally before committing changes
  - Automatically in CI pipelines on push and pull requests

---

## 6. Coverage and Quality

- Target **80%+ test coverage** on core game logic and API.
- Monitor coverage reports and address gaps regularly.
- Use static analysis tools to catch code smells and security issues early.

---

## 7. Responsibilities

- Developers write and maintain tests for their respective components.
- QA engineers focus on E2E, performance, and accessibility testing.
- Project lead reviews test results and coordinates bug triage.

---

## 8. Testing Schedule Based on Feature Milestones

- **After Core Infrastructure (Task 1 & 2):**  
  Unit and integration tests for session management and state handling.

- **Once Challenge Creation Workflow and Media Capture (Task 3 & Media Capture tasks) are functional:**  
  UI and validation tests for statement input, lie selection, video/audio recording, preview, and media upload.

- **After Challenge Publishing and Moderation (Task 5) implementation:**  
  Tests for backend APIs, content moderation pipeline, rate limiting, and validation services.

- **Following Guessing Engine and Gameplay (Task 6) completion:**  
  Integration and UI tests for challenge browsing, guessing interface, real-time feedback, hints, and animations. 

- **After User Authentication features are implemented:**  
  Unit and integration tests covering login/logout, registration flows, JWT handling, password reset, token refresh, and secure route protection.

- **Once Monetization system is integrated:**  
  Tests for purchase UI, receipt validation, entitlement management, promo code workflows, free trial logic, and event tracking.

- **When Emotion Analysis Integration (Task 4) is implemented (optional MVP):**  
  Testing AI scoring pipelines, frontend emotion overlays, fallback UI/logic, and validation against labeled samples.

- **After Progression and Rewards (Task 7) are live:**  
  Tests for leveling, experience, badge unlocks, cosmetics, leaderboard updates, and reward calculus.

- **Upon Performance and Optimization Tasks (Task 8) completion:**  
  Stress testing, load simulations, client-server caching validations, and rendering optimizations.

- **As Error Handling and Resilience (Task 9) complete:**  
  Testing network failure handling, offline mode behaviors, retry logic, graceful degradation, and user error messaging.

- **During Comprehensive Testing Suite (Task 10):**  
  Full end-to-end workflow tests, cross-browser and mobile device compatibility, accessibility validation, UI responsiveness, and fallback scenario tests. Include navigation testing between main game and demo pages.

- **Throughout Analytics, Monitoring, and Reporting (Task 11):**  
  Verification of gameplay, retention, monetization event tracking, backend health monitoring, and privacy-compliant logging.

- **Final Integration and Polishing (Task 12):**  
  Final QA, bug fixing, UI polishing including smooth animations, theming, documentation completion, and preparation of demo materials for hackathon submission.

---

## 9. Advanced Testing & Quality Assurance

**Post-MVP Enhancement**: After core gameplay is complete and mobile-deployed, implement comprehensive quality assurance measures outlined in the **Advanced Testing & QA Specification** (`docs/advanced-testing-qa-spec.md`).

This includes:
- Enhanced content moderation edge case testing
- End-to-end user journey automation  
- Performance and load testing
- Production monitoring and observability
- Security and compliance validation

See the dedicated specification for detailed implementation timeline and success criteria.

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

- Update this plan as project evolves.
- Gather feedback from testing cycles to refine processes.
- Implement advanced testing phases based on user adoption and scaling needs.
