# Testing Plan for 2Truths-1Lie Mobile App

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy, scope, tools, and schedule for the mobile-only 2Truths-1Lie React Native/Expo application. Comprehensive testing ensures a stable, performant, and user-friendly mobile product aligned with our hackathon and App Store deployment goals.

---

## 2. Testing Scope

- **Unit Testing:** Verify individual React Native components, mobile services, and utility functions (game logic, UI components, native API handlers).
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between mobile components and backend systems (API endpoints, real-time updates, native device features).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate complete mobile user workflows from challenge creation to guessing and scoring.
- **Device Testing:** Validate functionality across iOS and Android devices with different screen sizes and capabilities.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess mobile app responsiveness, memory usage, and battery efficiency.
- **Native Feature Testing:** Verify camera, microphone, storage, and permission workflows.
- **Offline Testing:** Ensure graceful degradation when network is unavailable.

---

## 3. Test Environments and Tools

- **Environments:**
  - Local development with Expo Go on physical devices
  - iOS and Android simulators for automated testing
  - EAS Build preview builds for production testing
  - TestFlight/Google Play Console internal testing

- **Tools:**
  - **Jest + React Native Testing Library** for unit and integration tests
  - **Expo Device Testing** for native feature validation
  - **Maestro** or **Detox** for E2E mobile automation
  - **Flipper** for debugging and performance profiling
  - **Sentry** for crash reporting and error tracking

---

## 4. Test Data and Fixtures

- Use synthetic and anonymized sample data to replicate real gameplay scenarios.
- Maintain test factories or fixture files to generate repeatable inputs.
- Mock external dependencies such as AffectLink API during automated tests.

---

## 5. Running Tests

- Include test scripts in mobile app's `package.json`:
  - `npm test` for unit/integration tests
  - `npm run test:coverage` for coverage reports
  - `npm run test:e2e` for end-to-end mobile tests
  - `npm run test:devices` for physical device validation

- Tests should be run:
  - Locally on simulators before committing changes
  - On physical devices for camera/microphone features
  - Automatically in CI/CD pipeline for each build
  - On TestFlight/Play Console before production release

---

## 6. Coverage and Quality

- Target **80%+ test coverage** on core game logic and API.
- Monitor coverage reports and address gaps regularly.
- Use static analysis tools to catch code smells and security issues early.

---

## 7. Responsibilities

- Developers write and maintain tests for their respective components.
- QA engineers focus on E2E, performance, and accessibility testing.
- Project lead reviews test results and coordinates bug triage.

---

## 8. Testing Schedule Based on Feature Milestones

- **After Core Mobile Infrastructure (Task 1 & 2):**  
  Unit and integration tests for React Native navigation, mobile state management, and device-specific session handling.

- **Once Challenge Creation Workflow and Mobile Media Capture are functional:**  
  UI and validation tests for mobile statement input, lie selection, native camera/microphone recording, video preview, and media storage on device.

- **After Challenge Publishing and Moderation implementation:**  
  Tests for mobile API integration, content moderation pipeline, rate limiting, and mobile-specific validation services.

- **Following Guessing Engine and Mobile Gameplay completion:**  
  Integration and UI tests for mobile challenge browsing, touch-optimized guessing interface, real-time feedback, mobile animations, and haptic feedback.

- **After Mobile Authentication features are implemented:**  
  Unit and integration tests covering mobile login/logout, biometric authentication, secure token storage, and mobile-specific JWT handling.

- **Once Mobile Monetization system is integrated:**  
  Tests for in-app purchase UI, App Store/Play Store receipt validation, mobile subscription management, and mobile analytics tracking.

- **When Emotion Analysis Integration is implemented (optional MVP):**  
  Testing mobile AI scoring pipelines, camera-based emotion detection, mobile-optimized emotion overlays, and offline fallback modes.

- **After Mobile Progression and Rewards are live:**  
  Tests for mobile leveling UI, achievement notifications, badge animations, mobile leaderboard updates, and reward persistence.

- **Upon Mobile Performance and Optimization completion:**  
  Native performance testing, memory profiling, battery usage analysis, network optimization validation, and mobile-specific caching.

- **As Mobile Error Handling and Resilience complete:**  
  Testing mobile network failure handling, offline mode behaviors, mobile retry logic, graceful mobile degradation, and native error messaging.

- **During Comprehensive Mobile Testing Suite:**  
  Full mobile workflow tests, cross-device compatibility (iOS/Android), accessibility validation, mobile UI responsiveness, and app store compliance testing.

- **Throughout Mobile Analytics, Monitoring, and Reporting:**  
  Verification of mobile-specific event tracking, native crash reporting, mobile performance monitoring, and privacy-compliant mobile logging.

- **Final Mobile Integration and Polishing:**  
  Final mobile QA, native bug fixing, mobile UI polishing including smooth native animations, mobile theming, app store preparation, and mobile demo materials.

---

## 9. Advanced Testing & Quality Assurance

**Post-MVP Enhancement**: After core gameplay is complete and mobile-deployed, implement comprehensive quality assurance measures outlined in the **Advanced Testing & QA Specification** (`docs/advanced-testing-qa-spec.md`).

This includes:
- Enhanced content moderation edge case testing
- End-to-end user journey automation  
- Performance and load testing
- Production monitoring and observability
- Security and compliance validation

See the dedicated specification for detailed implementation timeline and success criteria.

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

- Update this plan as project evolves.
- Gather feedback from testing cycles to refine processes.
- Implement advanced testing phases based on user adoption and scaling needs.
