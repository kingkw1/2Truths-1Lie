# Testing Plan for 2Truths-1Lie

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy, scope, tools, and schedule for the 2Truths-1Lie project. Comprehensive testing ensures a stable, performant, and user-friendly product aligned with our hackathon and production goals.

---

## 2. Testing Scope

- **Unit Testing:** Verify individual functions, components, and modules (game logic, UI components, API handlers).
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between components and backend systems (API endpoints, real-time updates).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate user workflows from challenge creation to guessing and scoring.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess responsiveness under load and concurrent user simulations.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Verify graceful degradation on failures (network loss, AI service downtime).

---

## 3. Test Environments and Tools

- **Environments:**
  - Local development with mocks and emulators
  - Staging server mirroring production setup for integrated testing
  - Production monitoring with analytics and error reporting

- **Tools:**
  - Jest for unit and integration tests
  - React Testing Library or equivalent for UI tests
  - Cypress or Playwright for E2E automation
  - Lighthouse and Axe for accessibility audits
  - Load testing tools like Artillery or JMeter
  - Sentry/Rollbar for runtime error tracking

---

## 4. Test Data and Fixtures

- Use synthetic and anonymized sample data to replicate real gameplay scenarios.
- Maintain test factories or fixture files to generate repeatable inputs.
- Mock external dependencies such as AffectLink API during automated tests.

---

## 5. Running Tests

- Include test scripts in `package.json` for easy command line execution:
  - `npm run test` for unit/integration tests
  - `npm run test:e2e` for end-to-end tests
  - `npm run test:lint` for linting and formatting checks

- Tests should be run:
  - Locally before committing changes
  - Automatically in CI pipelines on push and pull requests

---

## 6. Coverage and Quality

- Target **80%+ test coverage** on core game logic and API.
- Monitor coverage reports and address gaps regularly.
- Use static analysis tools to catch code smells and security issues early.

---

## 7. Responsibilities

- Developers write and maintain tests for their respective components.
- QA engineers focus on E2E, performance, and accessibility testing.
- Project lead reviews test results and coordinates bug triage.

---

## 8. Testing Schedule Based on Feature Milestones

- **After Core Infrastructure (Task 1 & 2):** Unit and integration tests for session management and state handling.
- **Once Challenge Creation Workflow (Task 3) is functional:** UI and validation tests for statement input and media capture.
- **After Guessing Engine (Task 6) completion:** Integration and UI tests for guess submission and feedback mechanics.
- **When Emotion Analysis integration (Task 4) is implemented:** Testing AI scoring pipelines and fallback behavior.
- **After Progression and Rewards (Task 7) are live:** Tests for leveling, unlocks, and leaderboard accuracy.
- **Upon performance optimization (Task 8):** Stress testing and load simulations.
- **As Error Handling and Resilience (Task 9) complete:** Testing network failures, offline modes, and graceful degradation.
- **During Comprehensive Testing Suite (Task 10):** Full end-to-end, accessibility, and cross-platform tests.
- **Throughout Analytics and Monitoring (Task 11):** Verification of data collection and privacy compliance.
- **Final Integration and Polishing (Task 12):** Final QA, bug fixing, and demo readiness validation.

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement

- Update this plan as project evolves.
- Gather feedback from testing cycles to refine processes.
