    * Set up your RevenueCat account and configure your initial products/entitlements in the dashboard.

    * Post your official "Shipaton Kickoff" on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or Devpost.

**Day 2 & 3: (Sept 19-20) - RevenueCat Integration (Android)**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * Integrate the RevenueCat SDK into your live Android build.

    * Implement and thoroughly test the purchase, restore, and promo code flows for judges.
* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
    * Post a screenshot of your new paywall UI, asking for feedback. This shows you're engaging with the community for the **#BuildInPublic Award**.
    * Share a code snippet or a quick story about how an AI tool (like Kiro or Gemini) helped scaffold the purchase logic. This is perfect content for the **Best Vibes Award**.

**Day 4 & 5: (Sept 21-22) - iOS Integration & Cross-Platform Validation**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * Begin the iOS port. Complete the Expo iOS setup and generate your first TestFlight beta build.

**Day 6 & 7: (Sept 23-24) - Community-Ready Features**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * Upgrade your user authentication from the MVP to a more robust system (full signup, password reset, etc.), as outlined in your development plan.
    * Implement the basic content moderation flow: a "Report" button on challenges and a simple flagging system on your backend.
* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
    * Post an end-of-week recap video or thread. Show off the working IAP flow, the new login screen, and the moderation feature. Frame it as "Making the app safe and ready for a real community."

#### **WEEK 2: Polish, Launch & Submission Sprint**

**Day 8: (Sept 25) - iOS Launch Push & Critical Flow Validation**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * **Critical Milestone**: Conduct a full, practice run-through of the test purchase and promo code flows on both a physical Android device and an iOS TestFlight build. This is to catch any platform-specific sandbox issues or App Store Connect/Play Console configuration gotchas early.
    * Finalize the iOS build for submission.
    * **Submit the app to the Apple App Store for review**. The sooner, the better, as review times can be unpredictable.
* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
    * Celebrate this milestone! Post a screenshot of the "Waiting for Review" status. This is a classic, high-engagement post for any indie developer journey.

**Day 9: (Sept 26) - The Design & Polish Sprint**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * Dedicate today to visual excellence for the **RevenueCat Design Award**.
    * Review every screen. Refine animations, clean up transitions, and ensure your branding is cohesive.

* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
    * Post before-and-after GIFs or screenshots showing a UI element you polished. Explain your design thinking.

**Day 10: (Sept 27) - Growth & Onboarding**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * Refine the user onboarding flow. How do you introduce the premium features to a new user? This is key for the **Build & Grow Award**.
    * Analyze any early data you have. To bootstrap metrics, get friends and family to install and use the app. Even tiny numbers ("We grew 200% from 5 to 15 users!") can be used to build a growth narrative.
* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
    * Share your download numbers, no matter how small. "Just hit 50 downloads on the Play Store! Small wins. Now working on improving the first-time user experience based on early feedback from our first users."

**Day 11: (Sept 28) - Rapid Bug Bash & Narrative Assembly**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * **Rapid Bug Bash**: Dedicate a focused block of time to fixing only the most critical, high-impact, or visually jarring bugs found during testing. This is your final stability lock before recording the demo.
    * Write the documentation and instructions for the judges, especially how to use the promo code to test premium features.
* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
    * Draft your submission essays. Start writing the story for each award, weaving together your social media posts, development challenges, and strategic decisions.

**Day 12: (Sept 29) - Final Assets & Award-Winning Video Production**

    * Conduct a final, full QA pass on both the iOS and Android versions of the app.
* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
    * **Record & Edit Demo Video with a Shot List**: Your 3-minute video is your pitch. Ensure your footage explicitly highlights the awards criteria:
        * **For the Design Award:** Show off your most polished UI, smoothest animations, and the clean onboarding flow.
        * **For the HAMM Award:** Clearly demonstrate the intuitive, non-intrusive purchase flow and the value of the premium features.
        * **For the Best Vibes Award:** Briefly show a "before/after" of a feature Kiro/Gemini helped build, or a screen where AI-generated content is used.
        * **For General Quality:** Show the content moderation ("Report" button) to demonstrate the app is community-safe and thoughtfully designed.

**Day 13: (Sept 30) - SUBMISSION DAY**
* **ðŸ’» Development Focus**:
    * Perform a final smoke test on both platforms. Double-check all submission requirements: URLs, icon, screenshots, promo code, and video link.
* **ðŸ“£ Public Focus (#BuildInPublic & Storytelling)**:
