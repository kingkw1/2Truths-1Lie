- Advance **guessing engine enhancements**:
  - Refine UI responsiveness, hints, animations, and scoring feedback.
- Increase **test coverage**â€”unit, integration, and begin **end-to-end test scripting** (Cypress, Playwright).
- Resolve initial feedback from Play Store closed testing.
- Prepare draft **Hackathon presentation materials** (video outline + demo flow).

***

### 3. **Hardening and Submission Prep (Sept 08 â€“ Sept 15)**

**Goal:** Submit to KiRo with top-notch MVP and solid demonstration.

- Conduct **full end-to-end testing** with emphasis on mobile device play.

### 4. **Post-KiRo / Shipaton Focus (Sept 15 â€“ Sept 29)**

**Goal:** Deliver full production readiness for Shipaton submission & Play Store publication.

- Integrate **backend persistent media upload** with queueing, validation, and cloud storage (e.g., S3).
- Complete **user authentication** flows: registration, login, password reset.
- Implement **monetization features** per Shipaton requirements:
  - RevenueCat SDK integration, purchase flows, restore purchases, promo/free trials.
- Expand **progression & rewards systems**: leveling, badges, cosmetics, leaderboards.
- Optimize **performance & scalability**:
