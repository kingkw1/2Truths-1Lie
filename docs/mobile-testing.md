## **A. Progressive Web App (PWA) Approach (Quick Browser Testing)**

If you just want to test your standard React app on Android via Chrome (no app store submission):

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This should usually start the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Find your computer’s local IP address.**
   - Run `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` / `ip addr` (Mac/Linux) to find something like `192.168.x.x`.

3. **Open up your firewall for port 3000 (if needed).**

4. **On your Android device, open Chrome and visit:**
   ```
   http://[your_local_ip]:3000
   ```

5. **You can add the site to your home screen for a pseudo-app experience:**
   - Tap the 3-dot menu > “Add to Home screen”.

_This is quick for testing, but does **not** allow for any native device features, nor will it pass for publishing in Shipaton/Play Store._

## **B. Expo/React Native Approach (Recommended for Shipaton/Store Submission)**

If you want to publish as a true mobile app (required for Shipaton), this is the way:

### 1. **Converting Your Project (if needed)**
- If you’re using Create React App, look into [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) or migrate your logic to an [Expo](https://expo.dev/) project.

### 2. **Set Up Expo (if not already):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   expo init your-project-name
   ```
   - Choose a blank (TypeScript, JS) or tabs template.
   - Copy key components and logic over.

### 3. **Start with Expo Go for Local Testing:**

- **Start the Expo development server:**
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```
- **Install the Expo Go app** from the Play Store on your Android device.
- **Scan the QR code** from your dev machine using Expo Go.

**Your app now runs on your phone!**
- Hot reload works between your computer and device.

### 4. **Direct Build & Install APK**

- **Build the APK:**
   ```bash
   expo build:android
   ```
   - If using EAS Build (expo’s cloud service):  
     ```bash
     eas build -p android
     ```
- **Download the APK file** from the build site, transfer it to your Android device.
- **On your device:**
   - Open the APK (ensure “Install from unknown sources” is enabled), and install your app.
- **Now test your app natively!**

### 5. **Test Device Features**
- Try camera, mic recording, notifications, and local file access.
- Make sure all permissions requests are handled in your code.

### 6. **Prepare for Play Store Submission**
- Configure your app manifest (icon, name, permissions).
- Validate with `expo build:android --release-channel production`.
- Proceed to Play Console submission steps (see [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/uploading-apps/)).
