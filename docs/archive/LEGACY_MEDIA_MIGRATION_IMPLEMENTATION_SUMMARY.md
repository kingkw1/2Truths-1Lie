# Legacy Media Migration Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive migration infrastructure for legacy blob/video references to persistent server URLs, covering both backend and mobile client-side migration capabilities.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Backend Migration Infrastructure (Already Existing)

**Files:**
- `backend/services/migration_service.py` - Core migration service
- `backend/migrate_challenge_urls.py` - CLI migration tool
- `backend/tests/test_challenge_url_migration.py` - Comprehensive test suite

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Challenge data model migration from blob URLs to persistent server URLs
- ✅ Cloud storage integration for media file migration
- ✅ Dry run capability for safe testing
- ✅ Batch processing for large datasets
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- ✅ Migration verification and status tracking

### 2. Mobile Migration Service (New Implementation)

**File:** `mobile/src/services/mediaMigrationService.ts`

**Key Features:**
- **Legacy Media Discovery**: Automatically discovers legacy blob URLs and local files in AsyncStorage and file system
- **Smart Migration Logic**: 
  - Blob URLs: Marked as non-migratable (temporary references)
  - Local files: Uploaded to server via upload service
  - Legacy server URLs: Resolved through cross-device service
- **Batch Processing**: Processes items in configurable batches to avoid overwhelming the system
- **Storage Updates**: Automatically updates stored references in AsyncStorage
- **Cleanup**: Optional cleanup of migrated local files
- **Status Tracking**: Persistent migration status and verification

**Migration Types Supported:**
- `blob:` URLs → Cannot migrate (temporary references)
- `file://` URLs → Upload to server and get persistent URL
- `/api/v1/files/` URLs → Resolve to current streaming URL
- Local document files → Upload and migrate

### 3. Migration CLI Utility (New Implementation)

**File:** `mobile/src/utils/migrationCli.ts`

**Features:**
- Command-line style interface for migration operations
- Dry run capability with detailed reporting
- Verification functionality
- Status summary and reporting
- Cleanup management
- Formatted output with progress indicators

**Usage Examples:**
```typescript
// Dry run to see what would be migrated
await migrationExamples.dryRun('user-123');

// Run actual migration with cleanup
await migrationExamples.migrate('user-123');

// Verify migration status
await migrationExamples.verify();

// Quick status check
await migrationExamples.status();
```

### 4. React Hooks for Migration (New Implementation)

**File:** `mobile/src/hooks/useMigration.ts`

**Hooks Provided:**
- `useMigration()` - Full migration functionality with state management
- `useMigrationStatus()` - Lightweight status checking
- `useAutoMigration()` - Automatic migration on app startup

**State Management:**
- Discovery state (loading, items found)
- Migration progress (running, results)
- Error handling and reporting
- Verification results
- Status persistence

### 5. Migration UI Component (New Implementation)

**File:** `mobile/src/components/MigrationStatusIndicator.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Status Indicator**: Shows migration status with visual indicators
- **Interactive Modal**: Full migration workflow UI
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time migration progress
- **Dry Run Support**: Test migration before actual execution
- **Results Display**: Detailed migration results with success/failure breakdown
- **Auto-hide**: Configurable visibility based on migration needs

**UI Flow:**
1. Status indicator shows migration needed
2. User taps to open migration modal
3. Discovery phase shows found legacy items
4. User can run dry run or actual migration
5. Progress tracking during migration
6. Results display with cleanup options

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite (New Implementation)

**Files:**
- `mobile/src/services/__tests__/mediaMigrationService.test.ts` - Unit tests for migration service
- `mobile/src/__tests__/MigrationIntegration.test.tsx` - Integration tests for complete workflow

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Legacy media discovery from AsyncStorage and file system
- ✅ Migration logic for different URL types
- ✅ Batch processing and error handling
- ✅ Storage updates and cleanup
- ✅ React hooks functionality
- ✅ UI component behavior
- ✅ Complete integration workflow
- ✅ Error scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ Performance with large datasets

## Migration Workflow

### Discovery Phase
1. **AsyncStorage Scan**: Searches for challenge data, draft challenges, and media cache
2. **File System Scan**: Discovers local media files in document directory
3. **Legacy Detection**: Identifies URLs that need migration:
   - `blob:` URLs (temporary browser references)
   - `file://` URLs (local file paths)
   - `/api/v1/files/` URLs (legacy server endpoints)
   - Localhost/127.0.0.1 URLs (development references)

### Migration Phase
1. **Validation**: Checks if files exist and are accessible
2. **Upload**: For local files, uploads to server via upload service
3. **Resolution**: For legacy server URLs, resolves through cross-device service
4. **Update**: Updates all stored references in AsyncStorage
5. **Verification**: Confirms migration success

### Cleanup Phase
1. **File Cleanup**: Optionally removes migrated local files
2. **Status Update**: Saves migration results and status
3. **Verification**: Confirms no legacy items remain

## Integration Points

### With Existing Services
- **Upload Service**: Uses `videoUploadService` for file uploads
- **Cross-Device Service**: Uses `crossDeviceMediaService` for URL resolution
- **Redux Store**: Integrates with auth state for user context
- **AsyncStorage**: Reads and updates stored challenge data

### With Backend Migration
- **Complementary**: Mobile migration handles client-side references
- **Backend Migration**: Handles server-side challenge data model
- **Unified**: Both use same persistent URL structure

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Migration on App Startup
```typescript
// In App.tsx or main component
const autoMigration = useAutoMigration({
  enabled: true,
  dryRunFirst: true,
  autoCleanup: false,
});

// Migration runs automatically after app initialization
```

### Manual Migration with UI
```typescript
// Add migration indicator to settings or main screen
<MigrationStatusIndicator 
  showDetails={true}
  autoHide={true}
  onMigrationComplete={(success) => {
    console.log('Migration completed:', success);
  }}
/>
```

### Programmatic Migration
```typescript
const migration = useMigration();

// Discover legacy items
await migration.discoverLegacyMedia();

// Run migration
const success = await migration.runMigration({
  dryRun: false,
  batchSize: 5,
  cleanup: true,
});

// Verify results
const verified = await migration.verifyMigration();
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- **Storage Errors**: Continues with available data
- **Network Errors**: Retries with exponential backoff
- **File Errors**: Skips inaccessible files
- **Partial Failures**: Reports per-item status

### User Communication
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time migration progress
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Status Reporting**: Detailed success/failure breakdown
- **Recovery Options**: Retry mechanisms for failed items

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing
- **Configurable Batch Size**: Default 5 items per batch
- **Rate Limiting**: Delays between batches to avoid overwhelming
- **Memory Management**: Processes items incrementally

### Background Processing
- **Non-blocking**: UI remains responsive during migration
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time status updates
- **Cancellation**: User can cancel long-running migrations

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Authentication**: Uses authenticated upload service
- **Validation**: Server-side validation of uploaded content
- **Access Control**: Respects user permissions and ownership

### Privacy
- **Local Processing**: Discovery happens locally
- **Minimal Data**: Only migrates necessary media references
- **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files after migration

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Background Sync**: Automatic migration during app idle time
2. **Selective Migration**: User choice of which items to migrate
3. **Progress Persistence**: Resume interrupted migrations
4. **Cloud Sync**: Cross-device migration status synchronization
5. **Analytics**: Migration success metrics and reporting

### Monitoring
1. **Migration Metrics**: Track success rates and performance
2. **Error Reporting**: Automated error reporting for failures
3. **Usage Analytics**: Understanding migration patterns
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Optimization opportunities
