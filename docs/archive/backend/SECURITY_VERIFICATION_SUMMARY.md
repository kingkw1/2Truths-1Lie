- Confirmed input validation and content moderation
- Validated configuration security settings

## Key Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
```python
# JWT token with comprehensive validation
def verify_token(self, token: str) -> dict:
    payload = jwt.decode(
        token, 
        settings.SECRET_KEY, 
        algorithms=[settings.ALGORITHM],
        audience="twotruthsalie-mobile",
        issuer="twotruthsalie-api"
    )
```

### Input Validation
```python
# Comprehensive file security validation
def _validate_filename_security(self, filename: str) -> ValidationResult:
    # Check for dangerous extensions
    if file_ext in self.DANGEROUS_EXTENSIONS:
        return ValidationResult(False, f"Dangerous file extension: {file_ext}")
    
    # Check for path traversal
    if '..' in filename or filename.startswith('/'):
        return ValidationResult(False, "Path traversal patterns detected")
```

### Content Moderation
```python
# Automated content analysis with pattern matching
def _analyze_text_content(self, text: str) -> ModerationResult:
    for reason, patterns in self.compiled_patterns.items():
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.search(text):
                detected_issues.append(reason)
```

### Rate Limiting
```python
# Per-user rate limiting with configurable windows
async def check_rate_limit(self, user_id: str, limit: int, window_hours: int):
    current_requests = len(self.user_requests.get(user_id, []))
    if current_requests >= limit:
        raise RateLimitExceeded(f"Rate limit exceeded")
```
