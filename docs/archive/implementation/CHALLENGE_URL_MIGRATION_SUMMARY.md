# Challenge Data Model Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the challenge data model to store persistent server URLs post-upload, replacing temporary blob URLs with durable cloud storage or local streaming URLs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Data Model Updates

**File: `backend/models.py`**
- Enhanced `Statement` model with new fields:
  - `streaming_url`: Optimized streaming URL (CDN or signed URL)
  - `cloud_storage_key`: Cloud storage key for direct access
  - `storage_type`: Storage type (local, cloud, or cloud_fallback)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `media_url` field

### 2. Frontend Type Updates

**File: `mobile/src/types/challenge.ts`**
- Updated `MediaCapture` interface with:
  - `streamingUrl`: Persistent server URL for playback
  - `cloudStorageKey`: Cloud storage key for direct access
  - `uploadSessionId`: Upload session ID for tracking
  - `isUploaded`: Whether media has been successfully uploaded to server
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `url` field

### 3. Service Layer Updates

**File: `backend/services/challenge_service.py`**
- Modified challenge creation to use persistent URLs from media upload service
- Added `get_all_challenges()` and `update_challenge()` methods for migration support
- Integrated with media upload service to get cloud storage URLs

**File: `mobile/src/services/uploadService.ts`**
- Updated `UploadResult` interface to include cloud storage metadata
- Enhanced return values with `cloudStorageKey` and `storageType`

**File: `mobile/src/services/mobileMediaIntegration.ts`**
- Updated media capture to include persistent URL fields
- Set `isUploaded` flag when upload completes successfully

### 4. State Management Updates

**File: `mobile/src/store/slices/challengeCreationSlice.ts`**
- Enhanced `completeUpload` action to handle full media capture data
- Updated to store both temporary and persistent URLs
- Added support for upload metadata

### 5. Migration Infrastructure

**File: `backend/services/migration_service.py`**
- Added `migrate_challenge_urls()` method to migrate existing challenges
- Intelligent detection of legacy URL patterns (blob:, /api/v1/files/)
- Support for both cloud and local storage migration
- Dry run capability for safe testing

**File: `backend/migrate_challenge_urls.py`**
- CLI tool for running challenge URL migrations
- Verification functionality to check migration status
- Comprehensive reporting and error handling

**File: `backend/tests/test_challenge_url_migration.py`**
- Complete test suite for migration functionality
- Tests for both dry run and actual migration scenarios
- Error handling and edge case coverage

## Migration Process

### Detection Logic
The migration identifies challenges that need URL updates by checking for:
- Blob URLs (`blob:http://...`)
- Legacy file URLs (`/api/v1/files/...`)
- Missing `streaming_url` field
- Missing or default `storage_type` values

### Migration Steps
1. **Discovery**: Scan all challenges for legacy URL patterns
2. **Media Resolution**: Resolve media file IDs to current storage locations
3. **URL Generation**: Generate persistent streaming URLs (cloud or local)
4. **Update**: Update challenge statements with new URL structure
5. **Verification**: Confirm successful migration

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Check migration status
python migrate_challenge_urls.py --verify

# Dry run migration (no changes)
python migrate_challenge_urls.py --dry-run

# Perform actual migration
python migrate_challenge_urls.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Persistence**: Videos remain accessible across app reinstalls and device changes
2. **Performance**: CDN integration for optimized global delivery
3. **Scalability**: Cloud storage handles large media files efficiently
4. **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms for storage failures
5. **Security**: Signed URLs and proper access controls
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality continues to work

## Testing

- ✅ Statement model validation with new fields
- ✅ Legacy challenge detection
- ✅ Dry run migration functionality
- ✅ Cloud storage URL generation
- ✅ Local storage fallback
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Migration verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Processing**: Process large numbers of challenges efficiently
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time migration progress updates
3. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert migrations if needed
4. **Automated Scheduling**: Periodic migration of new uploads
5. **Monitoring**: Health checks for migrated URLs

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/models.py` - Enhanced Statement model
- `backend/services/challenge_service.py` - Updated challenge creation and added migration support
- `backend/services/migration_service.py` - Added challenge URL migration functionality
- `backend/migrate_challenge_urls.py` - CLI migration tool
- `backend/tests/test_challenge_url_migration.py` - Migration test suite

### Frontend
- `mobile/src/types/challenge.ts` - Updated MediaCapture interface
- `mobile/src/services/uploadService.ts` - Enhanced upload result handling
- `mobile/src/services/mobileMediaIntegration.ts` - Updated media capture processing
