## Technical Implementation Details

### Mock Architecture
The testing framework uses sophisticated mocking to simulate realistic device behaviors:

```typescript
// Device scenario configuration
const mockDeviceScenarios = {
  IPHONE_13: {
    platform: 'ios',
    dimensions: { width: 390, height: 844 },
    cameraQuality: '1080p',
    storageAvailable: 50 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
  },
  // ... other devices
};

// Camera mock with device-specific behavior
jest.mock('expo-camera', () => ({
  CameraView: React.forwardRef(({ onCameraReady }, ref) => {
    React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
      recordAsync: jest.fn().mockImplementation(async (options) => {
        const device = global.__DEVICE_SCENARIO__;
        const deviceConfig = mockDeviceScenarios[device];
        
        // Simulate device-specific recording behavior
        const recordingDelay = device === 'LOW_END_ANDROID' ? 300 : 100;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, recordingDelay));
        
        return {
          uri: `file://device-recording-${device}-${Date.now()}.mp4`,
          fileSize: deviceConfig.baseFileSize * 1024 * 1024,
        };
