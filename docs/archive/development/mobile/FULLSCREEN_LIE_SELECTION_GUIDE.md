# Fullscreen Lie Selection Interface Documentation

## Overview

The `FullscreenLieSelectionScreen` is a new combined interface that merges the previous "Select the Lie" and "Preview Your Challenge" screens into a single, immersive full-screen experience. This streamlines the challenge creation process and provides a more intuitive user experience similar to the challenge guessing interface.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸŽ¬ Full-Screen Video Preview
- **Immersive Experience**: True full-screen video playback with minimal UI
- **Touch Controls**: Tap video to show/hide controls (auto-hide after 3 seconds)
- **Statement Navigation**: Easy switching between the three recorded statements
- **Video Quality**: Optimized playback with proper scaling and aspect ratio

### ðŸŽ¯ Intuitive Lie Selection
- **Clear Header**: "Select the Lie" title guides users throughout the process
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected lie statement is clearly highlighted
- **Mark as Lie Button**: Prominent button to designate current statement as the lie
- **Status Indicators**: Visual cues show which statement is marked as the lie

### ðŸ“± Mobile-Optimized Controls
- **Bottom Navigation**: Statement switching buttons positioned for thumb accessibility
- **Haptic Feedback**: Light, medium, and heavy haptic responses for different actions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across iOS and Android devices
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements meet accessibility guidelines (44px minimum)

### ðŸš€ Streamlined Workflow
- **No Edit Button**: Simplified interface removes unnecessary complexity
- **Retake Functionality**: Easy access to re-record individual statements
- **Submit Challenge**: Full-width button activates after lie selection
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during submission process

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
FullscreenLieSelectionScreen/
â”œâ”€â”€ Video Container (Full-screen)
â”œâ”€â”€ Header (Title + Navigation)
â”œâ”€â”€ Statement Navigation (Bottom)
â”œâ”€â”€ Action Buttons (Mark as Lie + Submit)
â””â”€â”€ Loading Overlays
```

### State Management
- **Redux Integration**: Seamless integration with existing challenge creation slice
- **Local UI State**: Manages video playback, controls visibility, and user interactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation before submission

### UI State Flow
1. **Video Preview**: Users can view each recorded statement in full-screen
2. **Lie Selection**: Mark any statement as the lie with visual confirmation
3. **Validation**: System ensures lie is selected before enabling submission
4. **Submission**: Process challenge creation with loading feedback

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Separate Screens)
1. Record statements
2. Select lie on dedicated screen
3. Navigate to preview screen
4. Review statements
5. Edit if needed
6. Submit challenge

### After (Combined Interface)
1. Record statements
2. **Preview + Select lie in single full-screen interface**
3. **Submit challenge directly**

### Benefits
- **50% Fewer Steps**: Eliminated separate preview screen navigation
- **Better Context**: Users can preview while selecting lie
- **Intuitive Flow**: Similar to challenge guessing experience
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Single interface vs. multiple screens

## Integration with Existing Code

### ChallengeCreationScreen Changes
- **Step Simplification**: Reduced from 4 steps to 3 steps
- **Conditional Rendering**: Fullscreen interface bypasses normal container
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing recording and submission logic preserved

### Redux Slice Integration
- **No Breaking Changes**: Uses existing `setLieStatement` and validation actions
- **State Consistency**: Maintains compatibility with existing challenge creation state

## File Structure
```
mobile/src/screens/
â”œâ”€â”€ ChallengeCreationScreen.tsx (Modified)
â””â”€â”€ FullscreenLieSelectionScreen.tsx (New)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Video Scrubbing**: Allow users to seek to specific parts of statements
- **Playback Speed Control**: Variable speed playback for detailed review
- **Statement Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison view
- **Accessibility Features**: Voice-over support and alternative input methods

### Performance Optimizations
- **Video Preloading**: Cache all statement videos for smooth switching
- **Memory Management**: Efficient video resource cleanup
- **Animation Optimization**: 60fps animations with native driver

## Development Notes

### Comments for Copilot
The code includes extensive comments explaining:
- **Merge Logic**: How the interface combines lie selection and preview
- **UI State Management**: Managing video playback and user interactions
- **Navigation Flow**: User journey through the combined interface
- **Integration Points**: How it connects with existing Redux state

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- **React Best Practices**: Hooks, memoization, and proper cleanup
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and efficient state updates
- **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets and haptic feedback

## Testing Considerations

### Key Test Cases
1. **Video Playback**: Ensure all statements play correctly
2. **Lie Selection**: Verify selection state and visual feedback
3. **Navigation**: Test switching between statements
4. **Submission**: Validate challenge creation flow
5. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid states and network issues

### Device Testing
- **iOS/Android**: Cross-platform compatibility
- **Screen Sizes**: Various device dimensions
- **Performance**: Memory usage and battery impact
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and motor impairment support
