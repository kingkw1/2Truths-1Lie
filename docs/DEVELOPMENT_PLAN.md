## üõ°Ô∏è RISK MANAGEMENT & CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### iOS Development & Monetization Risk Mitigation
- **Early iOS & RevenueCat Integration (Phase 5‚Äì9):** Begin iOS platform and RevenueCat SDK integration as early as feasible, enabling early detection of device- or store-specific IAP and entitlement issues.
- **Contingency Buffer:** Maintain at least a 1-day buffer between Android/monetization completion and iOS TestFlight/App Store submission deadlines.
- **Apple/Google Review Readiness:** Monitor App Store Connect and Google Play Console review queues daily once submitted; address feedback/failures rapidly and have legal/privacy documentation pre-reviewed.
- **Promo/Free Trial Access for Judging:** Test all promo code and free trial flows before final submission to guarantee all premium/unlockable features are easily demo-accessible by judges without setup friction.
- **Parallel Cross-Platform Build/Monetization Testing:** Ensure all in-app purchase, entitlement restore, and premium flows are tested in parallel and independently on both Android (Google Play) and iOS (App Store/TestFlight) devices.
- **Pre-Validated EAS+RevenueCat Pipeline:** Run successful end-to-end EAS (Expo Application Services) build + RevenueCat test purchase flows before critical submission dates.
- **Store Asset/Submission Pre-Approval:** Prepare 1024x1024 icons, vertical 1179px+ screenshots, and completed metadata one week before final Shipaton/Store deadline.

### Hackathon Deadline & Submission Contingencies
- **KiRo Submission Flexibility:** Demo video and submission can focus on Android if iOS review or monetization encounters delays, provided minimum Shipaton requirements are still fulfilled.
- **Shipaton iOS/Android Redundancy:** If iOS approval is delayed, ensure Android deployment is complete for at least one eligible live store listing; coordinate with Shipaton organizers regarding expected review times or access codes.
- **Monetization Feature Scope Management:** Prioritize and deliver required in-app purchases, free trial access, and promo code redemptions before considering advanced/secondary features.
- **Documentation & Judge Access Readiness:** Complete all cross-platform (iOS/Android) store guides, promo code distribution, and end-user testing documentation independent of store status.

### Technical & Compliance Risk Management
- **Device Coverage & Monetization Testing:** Focus QA on iPhone 12+ and iOS 16+, but validate RevenueCat purchase flows on all supported Play/App Store device types/tiers.
- **Performance & Compliance Monitoring:** Continuously check sub-3sec startup and <100MB memory, event logs for purchase/entitlement errors, and perform mock GDPR/CCPA audits.
- **Automated Purchase & Parity Validation:** Implement automated and manual tests to verify RevenueCat IAP functionality and feature unlock parity (premium features, entitlements) across platforms after each deploy/build.
- **Legal/Privacy Readiness:** Ensure all privacy and purchasing disclosures are present in-app and on store listings, and that any new privacy changes (iOS 16+, recent Play Store requirements) are addressed with final test builds.
- **RevenueCat Dashboard Monitoring:** Actively monitor the RevenueCat dashboard and analytics for abnormal patterns or failed test purchases.
