# Design System Guidelines

## Typography
- Use system fonts or Google Fonts for optimal performance.
- Maintain consistent font sizes and weights across components:
  - Headers: Bold, 24px+
  - Body text: 16px regular

## Colors
- Primary palette: soothing, modern tones (e.g., blues, greens) to support wellness/game theme.
- Use accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum) for readability.
- Feedback colors: green for correct guesses, red for incorrect, yellow for warnings.

## Layout & Spacing
- Follow a 4px or 8px baseline grid for margins and paddings.
- Responsive layouts that adapt to mobile and desktop breakpoints.

## UI Components
- Buttons: rounded corners, clear hover/focus states.
- Inputs: consistent styling with labels, errors, placeholder text.
- Feedback Animations: subtle but responsive (e.g., confetti for correct guess).

## Iconography
- Use consistent icon sets (e.g., Feather Icons or Material Icons).
- Icons should clarify actions and be sized appropriately with text.

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigable interactive elements.
- Screen reader labels for all buttons and images.
- ARIA roles used appropriately.

## Animation and Transitions
- Use smooth CSS transitions for feedback animations.
- Avoid excessive motion to prevent distraction.
