# Deployment Process

## Development and Staging
- Use separate environments for development, staging, and production.
- Staging environment mirrors production setup for reliable pre-release testing.
- Use environment variables for secrets; do not hard-code keys or credentials.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Use GitHub Actions or similar to automate:
  - Running tests on every push
  - Running lint and static analysis
  - Building front-end and backend Docker images or artifacts
  - Deploying to staging and production environments after passing checks

## Build Processes
- Frontend: Bundle with Webpack or similar; minify for production.
- Backend: Use Docker for consistent environment; deploy containers using managed services (Render, Railway).
  
## Rollback and Recovery
- Maintain previous successful builds/releases to allow rollback if deployment fails.
- Monitor app health during and after deployment to identify regressions quickly.

## Monitoring & Alerts
- Integrate application monitoring tools (Datadog, NewRelic).
- Set up alerts for failed deployments, downtime, or critical errors.

## Documentation & Configuration Management
- Keep deployment scripts and environment documentation version controlled.
- Document manual deployment steps for emergency scenarios.
