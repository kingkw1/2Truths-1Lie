# Monetization - Design

## Architecture

- Frontend integrates RevenueCat SDK for all purchase flows (iOS, Android)  
- Backend provides API endpoints for verifying purchase receipts and managing entitlements  
- Entitlement data persisted in database and cached client-side for fast feature gating  
- Promo code validation via backend logic with secure redemption tracking  
- Trial periods managed via backend with expiration monitoring  
- Analytics events generated on purchase, redemption, and subscription lifecycle  

## Data Flow

1. User initiates purchase → RevenueCat SDK handles payment UI and backend  
2. App receives purchase receipt → sends to backend for verification  
3. Backend validates receipt with RevenueCat servers and updates user entitlement records  
4. User’s app UI updates to reflect unlocked premium features instantly  
5. Promo codes and free-trial activations similarly update entitlements via backend APIs
