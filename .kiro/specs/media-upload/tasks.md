# Media Upload – Implementation Tasks

## Implementation Status
**✅ FULLY COMPLETE**: Video upload, server-side processing, and challenge management are fully implemented and deployed in production.

## Core Tasking - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Design and implement backend API endpoints for secure video upload and streaming retrieval  
- [x] Integrate cloud storage provider (AWS S3, Firebase, or equivalent) for persistent, scalable media storage  
- [x] Update client logic to record, compress, and upload video to backend with progress feedback  
- [x] Refactor challenge data model to store persistent server URLs post-upload  
- [x] Implement robust frontend upload UI (progress, cancel, retry, error states)  
- [x] Enforce strict server/client validation (file format, size, duration) before acceptance  
- [x] Ensure cross-device accessibility for uploaded videos (iOS/Android, multi-login)  
- [x] Add secure authentication/authorization flow to uploads and downloads  
- [x] Provide migration for legacy blob/video references to new URLs  
- [x] Write complete unit/integration/regression tests for upload process and error handling  
- [x] Update developer and user documentation to describe persistent media workflow  
- [x] (Optional) Integrate CDN and signed URL support for global scalable delivery  

## Combined Uploads - ✅ COMPLETE (Server-Side Implementation)
- [x] Update mobile client to record segment start/end time while merging three recorded videos  
- [x] Implement video merging logic on device for three statements  
- [x] Update upload workflow to send merged video file plus segment metadata to backend  
- [x] Modify backend and challenge data model to store and retrieve segment metadata with each challenge  
- [x] Update challenge creation API to accept merged video and segment timecodes  
- [x] Update mobile playback UI to present three selectable statement segments and seek/play video segment as needed  

## Challenge Visibility - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Debug and fix backend challenge CRUD endpoints to ensure challenges are persisted correctly  
- [x] Verify and stabilize authenticated challenge listing API (`GET /api/v1/challenges`) and detail API (`GET /api/v1/challenges/{id}`)  
- [x] Remove or disable mock/test challenge endpoints to avoid confusion  
- [x] Update frontend challenge browse screen to fetch and display real challenges from the live backend API  
- [x] Implement error handling in frontend for challenge load failures  
- [x] Validate challenge list UI updates when new challenges are created  
- [x] Write integration tests covering end-to-end creation, storage, retrieval, and display  
- [x] Update developer and user documentation to describe new segment-based challenge flow  

## Compression Integration  
- [x] Research and select reliable video compression libraries compatible with React Native for Android/iOS  
- [x] Implement automated compression of individual video statements before final merge  
- [x] Implement compression of the merged video file prior to upload initiation  
- [x] Update upload service to wait for compression completion before starting upload  
- [x] Adjust metadata capture logic to recalculate segment timestamps post-compression  
- [x] Enhance UI to display compression progress and handle compression errors gracefully  
- [x] Conduct cross-platform testing focusing on quality vs. compression ratio trade-offs  
- [x] Update documentation explaining compression process and its impact on upload and playback
