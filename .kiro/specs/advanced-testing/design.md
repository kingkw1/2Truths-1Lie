## Component Design

### 1. Enhanced Moderation Testing Framework  
Focused on robustness in content handling and abuse prevention.

- **Modular test classes** support complex edge case generation, concurrency, and language/encoding validation.

### 2. End-to-End Testing Framework (Expanded for Coverage)  

#### User Journey Orchestrator  
- Executes fully automated scenarios covering:  
  - Video recording lifecycle (start, pause, retake, submit)  
  - Challenge creation form inputs, validations, and submission  
  - Upload flows including error recovery and network failure simulations  
  - Play mode: video playback, guessing, scoring, and leaderboard updates  

#### Mobile Testing Interface  
- Supports a wide matrix of devices, OS versions, and network conditions  
- Includes detailed coverage of permission workflows, error states, and UX feedback  
- Integrates targeted tests for coverage gaps identified in core workflows  

***

### 3. Performance & Load Testing Framework  
Continues to validate backend and client system under load, with expanded focus on stress testing upload capacity and gameplay concurrency.

***

### 4. Production Monitoring & Observability System  
Robust error tracking, alerting, and business metric collection, with synthesis of test coverage insights and production telemetry.

- **Error Tracking Service** captures detailed runtime issues with enhanced user context and session replay.
- **Metrics Collector** monitors engagement, retention, success metrics of core flows, and quality indicators.

***

## Coverage Strengthening Strategy (New Section)

### Objectives:

- Increase test coverage to >90% in critical functionalities relating to:  
  - Video capture and recording reliability  
  - Challenge creation flow validation  
  - Media upload robustness and error handling  
  - Gameplay interaction and scoring accuracy  

### Approach:

- **Comprehensive unit and integration test expansion** covering uncovered edge cases and async flows.
- **Augmented mocking strategies** for device APIs and external services to simulate failure modes.
- **Layered test suites:**  
  - Redux state tests covering all transitions and validation states  
  - Component interaction tests where possible to improve UI coverage  
  - End-to-end tests orchestrating full user scenarios with varying inputs and failures  
- **Regular coverage audits** feeding back into backlog prioritization.

## Security, Compliance, and Maintainability (Retained As-Is)

- Isolation of test environments, data anonymization
- Compliance with GDPR, COPPA, and security standards
- Continuous maintenance of tests and refactoring for test health

***

## Next Steps

- Integrate coverage goals and detailed test scope into CI pipeline quality gates.
- Leverage test results for adaptive test expansion.
- Prioritize backlog tickets for coverage improvements aligned with demo and production risk areas.
