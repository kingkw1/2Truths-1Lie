# Advanced Testing Implementation Plan

## Overview  
This plan prioritizes strengthening test coverage on critical workflows—particularly those involved in recording, challenge creation, video upload, and gameplay—to support robust, reliable operation and polished hackathon demos.

***

## Implementation Phases (Reordered by priority)

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Stabilization & Coverage Expansion (High Priority, 2-3 weeks)

#### Automated (Kiro-enabled) Tasks:
- [ ] Fix mobile Jest configuration to resolve Expo module import issues and enable test execution
- [ ] Implement comprehensive mobile test mocking infrastructure for Expo modules
- [ ] Expand critical workflow test coverage to >90% for recording, creation, upload, and gameplay
- [ ] Implement Redux state management tests for all core application states

#### Manual Tasks:
- [ ] Review automated test results and refine test scenarios for uncovered scenarios
- [ ] Human validation of test stability and realistic scenarios (device testing, delays)
- [ ] Code review of new tests ensuring maintainability and adherence to standards

***

### Phase 2: End-to-End Testing Framework Implementation (4-6 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Set up Detox for React Native E2E testing with iOS and Android configurations
- [ ] Implement core user journey automation for creator and guesser workflows
- [ ] Add network condition simulation testing for offline and connectivity scenarios

#### Manual Tasks:
- [ ] Define and tune user journey steps from UX perspective
- [ ] Manual exploratory testing for edge-case network and permission flows
- [ ] Cross-platform validation on physical devices

***

### Phase 3: Performance and Load Testing Implementation (3-4 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Set up Artillery load testing infrastructure for API stress testing
- [ ] Implement Lighthouse CI for automated frontend performance monitoring
- [ ] Build performance testing pipeline integration with CI/CD and reporting

#### Manual Tasks:
- [ ] Monitor performance dashboards and interpret results
- [ ] Conduct manual stress tests on resource-constrained devices
- [ ] Triage and optimize based on identified bottlenecks

***

### Phase 4: Production Monitoring & Observability Implementation (2-3 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Implement Sentry error tracking and monitoring for mobile app and backend
- [ ] Deploy business metrics collection system with real-time KPI dashboards
- [ ] Configure production alerting system with health checks and escalation rules

#### Manual Tasks:
- [ ] Configure alert thresholds and escalation paths
- [ ] Regularly review logs and reports for trend analysis
- [ ] Establish incident response procedures

***

### Phase 5: Security and Compliance Testing Implementation (4 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Implement OWASP ZAP automated security scanning for vulnerability detection
- [ ] Add GDPR and COPPA privacy compliance testing workflows
- [ ] Create security testing pipeline with CI/CD integration and reporting

#### Manual Tasks:
- [ ] Conduct security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Review compliance documentation and legal requirements
- [ ] Address regulatory requirements and security findings

## Prioritized Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Fix the broken mobile test infrastructure to enable reliable test execution
2. **Focus on critical workflows**: Prioritize test coverage for recording, creation, upload, and gameplay flows
3. **Build incrementally**: Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring stable foundation before advancing
4. **Maintain quality gates**: Ensure all tests pass and coverage thresholds are met before proceeding

**This workflow focuses on implementation tasks only. The actual execution should be done through separate task-by-task implementation.**
