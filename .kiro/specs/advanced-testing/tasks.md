# Advanced Testing Implementation Plan

## Overview  
This plan prioritizes strengthening test coverage on critical workflows—particularly those involved in recording, challenge creation, video upload, and gameplay—to support robust, reliable operation and polished hackathon demos.

***

## Implementation Phases (Reordered by priority)

### Phase 1: Coverage Expansion & Core Workflow Stabilization (High Priority, 2-3 weeks)

#### Automated (Kiro-enabled) Tasks:
- [ ] Identify coverage gaps from existing reports; generate targeted tests for recording workflows including start, pause, resume, error recovery.
- [ ] Augment challenge creation tests: input validation, media attachment, lie selection logic, and state transitions.
- [ ] Expand upload flow tests with success, failure, retry, and network disruption scenarios.
- [ ] Enhance gameplay tests: video playback accuracy, guess submission, scoring logic, and UI feedback.
- [ ] Implement redux slice tests covering recording state, upload metadata, and gameplay guessing states.
- [ ] Automate testing of error and edge-case handling within these workflows.

#### Manual Tasks:
- [ ] Review automated test results and refine test scenarios for uncovered scenarios.
- [ ] Human validation of test stability and realistic scenarios (device testing, delays).
- [ ] Code review of new tests ensuring maintainability and adherence to standards.

***

### Phase 2: End-to-End User Journey Automation (4-6 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Automate entire creator journey: registration, recording, challenge preview & submission, including error and edge cases.
- [ ] Automate guesser journey: browse, video playback, guess input, scoring updates.
- [ ] Automate social interactions: sharing, commenting, reporting flows.
- [ ] Integrate network condition simulations: offline mode, packet loss, slow network.
- [ ] Implement cross-platform test runs on iOS and Android devices and emulators via Detox/Cypress.

#### Manual:
- [ ] Define and tune user journey steps from UX perspective.
- [ ] Manual exploratory testing especially for edge-case network and permission flows.

***

### Phase 3: Performance and Load Testing (3-4 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Implement load tests simulating 100+ concurrent challenge creators and 500+ guessers using Artillery/JMeter.
- [ ] Run API rate limiting stress scenarios.
- [ ] Automate front-end performance monitoring (Lighthouse CI, RUM).
- [ ] Build pipeline integration for performance tests with pass/fail thresholds.

#### Manual:
- [ ] Monitor performance dashboards, interpret results.
- [ ] Conduct manual stress tests on devices prone to low resources.
- [ ] Triage and optimize based on bottlenecks identified.

***

### Phase 4: Production Monitoring & Observability (2-3 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Implement error tracking with Sentry/Bugsnag integrated in app and backend.
- [ ] Deploy MetricsCollector to capture real-time business KPIs.
- [ ] Automate alert rules for high-severity errors and service degradations.
- [ ] Generate periodic reports on error trends and system health.

#### Manual:
- [ ] Configure alert thresholds and escalation paths.
- [ ] Regularly review logs and reports, assign triage.

***

### Phase 5: Security and Compliance Testing (4 weeks)

#### Automated:
- [ ] Run OWASP top 10 vulnerability scans using automated tools.
- [ ] Automate testing of privacy compliance workflows and data handling.
- [ ] Simulate attacks on file uploads and API endpoints for injection and auth bypass.

#### Manual:
- [ ] Security audit and penetration tests by specialist.
- [ ] Compliance review and documentation updates.
- [ ] Address legal and regulatory requirements.

## Prioritized Next Steps

1. Launch **Phase 1 Coverage Expansion** with targeted, Kiro-driven automated tests on recording, creation, upload, and playback.
2. Concurrently enable manual test plan reviews and initiate exploratory device testing.
3. Upon phase 1 completion, advance to **Phase 2 E2E automation**, prioritize flows for upcoming hackathon demo.
4. Maintain ongoing manual and automated triage to ensure test health.
