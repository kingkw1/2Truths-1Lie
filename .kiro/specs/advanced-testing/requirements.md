# Advanced Testing & Quality Assurance

## Overview
This specification defines comprehensive testing and quality assurance measures to be implemented after core gameplay functionality is complete and mobile-deployed. This builds upon existing solid testing foundation to create enterprise-grade quality assurance.

## Core Requirements

### REQ-1: Enhanced Content Moderation Testing
**Priority: High**  
**Description**: Comprehensive testing of content moderation pipeline edge cases and sophisticated abuse scenarios  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All moderation edge cases handle malformed data gracefully
- Unicode and multilingual content processed correctly  
- Sophisticated spam patterns detected with >95% accuracy
- Concurrent moderation scenarios resolved without conflicts
- False positive rate <0.1% for legitimate content

### REQ-2: End-to-End User Journey Automation  
**Priority: High**  
**Description**: Complete automation of critical user workflows from challenge creation to scoring  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Challenge creator journey fully automated (registration → recording → publishing)
- Challenge guesser journey fully automated (browse → guess → scoring → leaderboard)
- Social interaction flows automated (sharing, inviting, commenting, reporting)
- Cross-platform mobile testing on iOS and Android devices
- Network condition testing (3G, 4G, WiFi, offline scenarios)

### REQ-3: Performance & Load Testing
**Priority: Medium**  
**Description**: System performance validation under realistic and stress load conditions  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- API handles 50 concurrent challenge creators without degradation
- System supports 500 concurrent users guessing on challenges  
- Rate limiting blocks 100% of abuse attempts under load
- Video upload stress testing completes without data corruption
- Frontend performance maintains >90 Lighthouse score under load

### REQ-4: Production Monitoring & Observability
**Priority: Medium**  
**Description**: Comprehensive error tracking, alerting, and business metrics collection  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Error tracking captures <0.1% unhandled error rate
- Critical errors trigger alerts within 1 minute
- Real-time dashboard displays key business metrics
- User session replay available for debugging reported issues
- Automated weekly quality reports generated

### REQ-5: Security & Compliance Testing
**Priority: Low**  
**Description**: Security penetration testing and data privacy compliance validation  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities found
- OWASP Top 10 compliance validated
- User data properly encrypted and GDPR-compliant
- File upload security prevents malicious media execution
- Session management and authentication cannot be bypassed

## Implementation Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Core gameplay flow (Tasks 6-8) completed and mobile-deployed
- Basic backend API testing in place (already complete)
- Initial user feedback collected from MVP deployment
- Production environment configured and operational

### Technical Dependencies  
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing
- Artillery or JMeter for load testing
- Sentry or Rollbar for error tracking
- Performance monitoring service (New Relic, DataDog, or custom)
- Mobile testing framework (Detox for React Native or Appium)

## Success Metrics

### Quality Targets
- **System Uptime**: 99.9%+ availability
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating average
- **Bug Escape Rate**: <1 critical bug per month in production  
- **Performance**: <3 second loading time 95th percentile
- **Security**: Zero successful attacks on user data

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Test Coverage**: 85%+ for critical business logic
- **E2E Test Coverage**: 100% of critical user journeys
- **API Test Coverage**: 100% of public API endpoints
- **Mobile Test Coverage**: 95%+ of target device/OS combinations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- E2E test suite completes in <5 minutes
- Load tests simulate 5x expected traffic without system failure
- Moderation pipeline processes 100 submissions/second
- Mobile app startup time <3 seconds on mid-range devices

### Reliability Requirements  
- Test suite has <1% flaky test failure rate
- Automated tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline 95%+ of time
- Production monitoring detects issues before user impact
- Rollback procedures tested and validated monthly

### Maintainability Requirements
- Test code follows same quality standards as production code
- Test documentation updated with each new test implementation
- Regular test debt assessment and cleanup performed
- Test framework upgrades planned and executed quarterly
