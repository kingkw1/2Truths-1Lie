# Advanced Testing & Quality Assurance

## Overview  
This specification defines comprehensive testing and quality assurance measures to be implemented following the completion of core gameplay functionality and mobile deployment. It builds upon the existing solid testing foundation to establish enterprise-grade quality assurance, with an expanded focus on increasing test coverage on critical workflows essential for user experience and hackathon demos.

## Core Requirements

### REQ-1: Enhanced Content Moderation Testing  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Comprehensive testing of the moderation pipeline, ensuring robustness against diverse content inputs and abuse patterns.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- All moderation edge cases handle malformed and adversarial data gracefully.  
- Unicode and multilingual content correctly processed.  
- Detection of sophisticated spam patterns with over 95% accuracy.  
- Concurrent moderation scenarios resolved without conflicts.  
- False positive moderation rate below 0.1% for legitimate content.

### REQ-2: End-to-End User Journey Automation  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Complete automation of key user workflows to validate functional correctness and usability.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Automated testing of the full challenge creator journey: registration, recording, submission, publishing.  
- Automated testing of the guesserâ€™s journey: discovery, video playback, guess selection, scoring, and leaderboard updates.  
- Automation of social interaction flows: challenge sharing, invitations, commenting, reporting.  
- Cross-platform mobile testing coverage on iOS and Android devices across supported OS versions.  
- Network condition simulations: offline, slow network, intermittent connectivity scenarios included.

### **REQ-2a: Expanded Critical Workflow Test Coverage**  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Strengthen test coverage specifically on the critical workflows involved in challenge creation, video recording, upload, and gameplay to ensure robustness in hackathon demo scenarios and real-world usage.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Test coverage exceeds 90% on all components involved in recording, editing, and submitting video statements.  
- Comprehensive tests cover success, failure, and edge cases in video upload and processing.  
- Coverage extends to user interactions during gameplay, including video playback, guessing accuracy, and result display.  
- Recovery behaviors tested for error handling during media capture and upload failures.  
- Inclusion of tests validating Redux state transitions and UI feedback related to these workflows.  

### REQ-3: Performance & Load Testing  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Validate system stability and responsiveness under anticipated and stress loads.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Backend API sustains 50 simultaneous challenge creators without performance degradation.  
- System supports 500 concurrent guessers with smooth experience.  
- Effective rate limiting against abuse scenarios under load.  
- Video upload process handled reliably during high traffic.  
- Frontend maintains a Lighthouse score above 90 under simulated load.

### REQ-4: Production Monitoring & Observability  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Implement and verify monitoring for error tracking and business health metrics.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Real-time capture of errors, with a maximum of 0.1% unhandled errors in production.  
- Critical errors trigger alerts within one minute for rapid response.  
- Dashboard displays key business metrics, including challenge creation and engagement rates.  
- User session replay functionality available for enhanced debugging.  
- Automated generation and distribution of weekly quality and performance reports.

### REQ-5: Security & Compliance  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Ensure platform security and regulatory compliance through rigorous testing.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities discovered in penetration tests.  
- Full OWASP Top 10 compliance.  
- Cookies, tokens, and session management adhere to industry standards.  
- Privacy compliance guaranteed (GDPR, COPPA).  
- Prevention of malicious media upload exploits.

## Implementation Dependencies

### Prerequisites  
- Core gameplay flows fully developed and deployed.  
- Baseline backend API tests established.  
- Initial user feedback incorporated from MVP.  
- Production environment operational.

### Technical Dependencies  
- Automated E2E tools: Cypress, Playwright, Detox.  
- Load and stress testing: Artillery, JMeter.  
- Monitoring platforms: Sentry, DataDog (or equivalent).  
- Source control and CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions or similar.

## Success Metrics

### Quality and Coverage Targets  
- Automated test coverage increased across critical workflows to >= 90%.  
- End-to-end test suite executes within 5 minutes reliably.  
- Achieve 100% automation of core user journey tests relevant to demos and submissions.  
- Maintain production error rate below 0.1%.  
- User satisfaction metrics indicate minimal workflow discovered bugs post-release.

### Non-Functional Targets  
- Test suite flakiness remains below 1%.  
- CI/CD pipelines enforce coverage thresholds and report regressions.  
- Responsive monitoring and alerting infrastructure engaged for production.

## Next Steps  
- Define detailed test scenarios addressing both normal and edge cases covering recording, creation, and gameplay workflows.  
- Prioritize automated test implementation in the current sprint aligned with demo preparation.  
- Continuously analyze coverage reports, incrementing tests to close gaps.  
- Leverage Kiro specs to manage requirements, design, and tasks for coverage enhancement.
