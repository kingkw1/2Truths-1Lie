# User Authentication - Design

## Architecture

- Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication  
- Backend APIs for login, password reset, profile fetch/update  
- Encrypted storage of user credentials  
- Middleware for authorization on protected endpoints

## Data Flow

1. Users submit login credentials â†’ backend validates and returns token  
2. Clients store JWT locally and attach to API requests  
3. Server middleware verifies tokens on each request  
4. Profile APIs serve user-related data securely
