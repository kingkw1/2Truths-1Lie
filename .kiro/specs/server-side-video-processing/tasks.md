# Media Upload Migration to Server-Side Merging — Tasks

## Implementation Status
**✅ FULLY COMPLETE**: Server-side video merging and FFmpeg processing pipeline is fully implemented and deployed in production.

## Cleanup & Setup - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Remove client-side video merging and compression logic.
- [x] Refactor mobile upload flow to send three separate video files per challenge.

## Backend – Upload & Merge - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement `/api/v1/challenge-videos/upload-for-merge` backend endpoint for multi-video upload.
- [x] Develop backend logic to merge videos using FFmpeg asynchronously.
- [x] Integrate video compression in merge pipeline with standard parameters.
- [x] Upload merged video to S3 and remove individual uploaded videos.
- [x] Calculate and store segment metadata (start/end times) in challenge records.
- [x] Return merged video URL and metadata through upload response.

## Backend – Challenge Management - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Update challenge creation endpoint to accept merged video URL and segment metadata.
- [x] Implement authenticated `GET /api/v1/challenges` to list challenges with merged data.
- [x] Build `GET /api/v1/media/{id}` endpoint to serve video assets with secure signed URLs.
- [x] Set up monitoring and logging for media processing failures.

## Client – Upload & Playback - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Change mobile upload service to upload individual videos to the merge endpoint.
- [x] Handle asynchronous merge status updates and display progress to users.
- [x] Update challenge creation on client to use merged video data.
- [x] Modify playback UI for segmented video navigation based on server metadata.
- [x] Implement robust error handling for upload and playback.

## Testing - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Write unit tests for backend merge logic and media processing.
- [x] Create integration tests for multi-video upload and merge endpoints.
- [x] Automate end-to-end tests covering user video capture, upload, challenge creation, and playback.
- [x] Conduct device testing for playback UI and network resilience.
- [x] Verify compliance with all security and validation requirements.

## Documentation
- [x] Update developer documentation with new API definitions and media flow.
- [x] Revise user guides describing improved upload and playback features.
- [x] Document monitoring and alerting processes for media pipeline.

## Future Work
- [ ] Research advanced compression options and user quality controls.
- [ ] Explore CDN integration for optimal content delivery.
