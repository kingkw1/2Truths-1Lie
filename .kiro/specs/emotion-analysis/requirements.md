# Emotion Analysis - Requirements

## User Story 1: Real-Time Emotion Scoring

WHEN a player records and submits media  
THE SYSTEM SHALL process the media using the AffectLink API or equivalent to generate emotion embeddings and confidence scores  
AND return scores within a user-acceptable latency (e.g., < 5 seconds)

## User Story 2: Emotion-Based Gameplay Feedback

WHEN emotion analysis completes  
THE SYSTEM SHALL display visual indicators or overlays that reflect detected emotions and clue players about potential deception  
AND provide confidence levels on emotional signals and the likelihood of lie detection

## User Story 3: Graceful Degradation

WHEN AI services are unavailable or fail to respond  
THE SYSTEM SHALL degrade gracefully by disabling emotion-based feedback and continuing game operation with minimal disruption  
AND notify users of limitations transparently

## User Story 4: Data Privacy and User Consent

WHEN media is processed for emotion analysis  
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure user consent for data usage is obtained and recorded  
AND anonymize or securely handle emotion data in line with privacy regulations
