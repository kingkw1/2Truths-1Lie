# Emotion Analysis - Design

## Architecture

- Media files and text inputs are sent asynchronously from backend after initial submission  
- AffectLink emotion analysis runs as a background service or serverless function to extract multimodal features (facial, vocal, linguistic)  
- Results stored in database linked to game session and user  
- Frontend subscribes via WebSocket or polling to receive completed analysis and updates UI accordingly  

## Data Flow

1. Player submits media via challenge creation API  
2. Backend stores media and enqueues emotion analysis job  
3. Emotion analysis service retrieves job, processes input, and generates emotion scores  
4. Scores and metadata saved and linked to the challenge record  
5. Frontend receives event notification and updates UI with emotion overlays and confidence feedback  

## Performance Considerations

- Implement caching or batching of analysis jobs for efficiency  
- Prioritize low-latency processing for active games, defer deep analysis for offline processing  
- Design API to support fallback and retry logic  

## Interfaces

- Define standard schema for emotion embeddings and confidence intervals  
- Provide abstraction layer to swap emotion analysis providers or models easily
