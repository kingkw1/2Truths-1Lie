- Follow existing Redux slice patterns for state management  
- Integrate with existing `useAuth` hook for authentication
- Use existing modal and button component patterns

## Automation Summary

### ✅ FULLY AUTOMATABLE (Kiro Implementation)
- React Native component creation (ReportButton, ReportModal)
- Redux state management setup (reportingSlice)
- API service integration (reportService)
- GameScreen integration (add report buttons)
- Basic unit tests for components
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Component styling and layout

### ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL TESTING/VALIDATION
- **(MANUAL) Toast notifications** - UI behavior validation and user experience testing
- **(MANUAL) Success/error feedback** - UX flow validation and error message clarity

- **(MANUAL) Integration tests** - Cross-service communication validation
- **(MANUAL) E2E testing** - Complete user journey from report to resolution
- **(MANUAL) User feedback systems** - Toast timing, message clarity, accessibility
- **(MANUAL) Authentication flow testing** - User experience with auth requirements

### 📋 ESTIMATED EFFORT

- **Manual Validation**: ~10% focused on UX and integration testing
- **Critical Manual Items**: E2E testing, user experience validation

### 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS
Since backend is complete, focus is entirely on mobile UI components that integrate with existing, tested backend APIs.
