# Content Moderation Implementation Tasks

## Infrastructure Status: ‚úÖ BACKEND SERVICE IMPLEMENTED

**Current State**: The project has a comprehensive `ModerationService` with content filtering, status enums, extensive test coverage, and Challenge model integration. User authentication system is fully operational. This task list focuses on completing the missing API endpoints and mobile reporting interface.

## Backend Tasks

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- [x] Challenge model has moderation status fields (status enum includes PENDING_MODERATION, MODERATED)
- [x] User model implemented with authentication fields
- [ ] Create user_reports table (id, challenge_id, user_id, reason, details, created_at)
- [ ] Add foreign key constraints and indexes

### 2. API Endpoints - MISSING
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: POST /api/v1/challenges/{id}/report (user reporting)
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: GET /api/v1/admin/moderation/reports (admin dashboard) 
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: PUT /api/v1/admin/moderation/challenges/{id} (admin review)
- [ ] Add authentication middleware for reporting endpoints
- [ ] Add admin permission checks for moderation endpoints

### 3. Business Logic ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] ModerationService with content filtering
- [x] ModerationStatus and ModerationReason enums
- [x] ModerationResult class with comprehensive fields
- [x] Challenge status integration
- [ ] User report deduplication logic
- [ ] (MANUAL) Admin notification system for new reports

## Frontend/Mobile Tasks

### 4. React Native Components - MISSING  
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: ReportButton component (flag icon, tap handler)
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: ReportModal component (reason selection, submit)
- [ ] ReportService for API calls
- [ ] Integration with GameScreen challenge browser
- [ ] (MANUAL) Toast notifications for report confirmation

### 5. State Management - MISSING
- [ ] Add reporting state to Redux store
- [ ] Report submission actions and reducers  
- [ ] Error handling for network failures
- [ ] Authentication integration for user reports

### 6. UI/UX Integration - MISSING
- [ ] Add report buttons to challenge cards in GameScreen
- [ ] Report modal with reason dropdown (matches backend enum)
- [ ] (MANUAL) Success/error feedback to users
- [ ] (MANUAL) Disable report button after submission

## Testing Tasks

### 7. Backend Testing ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- [x] ModerationService unit tests
- [x] Challenge moderation integration tests
- [ ] (MANUAL) API endpoint testing for reporting functionality
- [ ] (MANUAL) Admin workflow testing

### 8. Mobile Testing - MISSING
- [ ] ReportButton component tests
- [ ] ReportModal component tests  
- [ ] (MANUAL) Report submission integration tests
- [ ] (MANUAL) E2E testing for complete reporting workflow

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: API Foundation (Backend)
1. **Create user_reports database table** - Foundation for storing user reports
2. **Implement POST /api/v1/challenges/{id}/report** - Core user reporting functionality
3. **Add authentication middleware** - Ensure user identification for reports
4. **(MANUAL) Test API functionality** - Validate reporting endpoint works

### Phase 2: Mobile User Interface  
1. **Create ReportButton component** - User-facing report interface
2. **Create ReportModal component** - Report reason selection and submission
3. **Integrate with GameScreen** - Add report buttons to challenge browser
4. **Add Redux state management** - Handle reporting state and feedback

### Phase 3: Admin Tools
1. **Implement admin endpoints** - GET reports, PUT review actions
2. **Add admin permissions** - Secure administrative functionality
3. **(MANUAL) Create admin notification system** - Alert admins of new reports

## Technical Dependencies

### Required for Implementation
- **Authentication System**: ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (JWT tokens, user identification)
- **Challenge Model**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (moderation status fields exist)
- **ModerationService**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (content filtering, enums, testing)
- **Database Connection**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (SQLite with user and challenge tables)

### External Dependencies
- **React Native Navigation**: ‚úÖ Available (for modal presentation)
- **Redux Store**: ‚úÖ Available (for state management)
- **API Service Layer**: ‚úÖ Available (for HTTP requests)

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [ ] Users can report inappropriate challenges with reason selection
- [ ] Reports are stored in database with user attribution
- [ ] (MANUAL) Basic admin interface for reviewing reports
- [ ] (MANUAL) Report submission provides user feedback

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All new API endpoints have test coverage
- [ ] Mobile components have unit tests
- [ ] (MANUAL) End-to-end reporting workflow is tested
- [ ] (MANUAL) Authentication and authorization are enforced

## Implementation Notes

**Backend Focus**: The comprehensive ModerationService infrastructure is complete. Focus on API endpoints that connect user reporting to existing moderation systems.

**Mobile Focus**: Simple, intuitive reporting interface that leverages existing authentication and navigation systems.

**Admin Focus**: Basic review interface initially - advanced admin dashboard can be phase 2 enhancement.

## Automation Summary

### ‚úÖ FULLY AUTOMATABLE (Kiro + VS Code Copilot)
- Database schema creation (user_reports table)
- API endpoint implementation (POST, GET, PUT routes)
- Authentication middleware integration
- React Native component creation (ReportButton, ReportModal)
- Redux state management setup
- API service integration
- Basic unit tests for components
- Admin permission checks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES MANUAL TESTING/VALIDATION
- **(MANUAL) Admin notification system** - Email/SMS setup requires external service configuration
- **(MANUAL) Toast notifications** - UI behavior validation and user experience testing
- **(MANUAL) Success/error feedback** - UX flow validation and error message clarity
- **(MANUAL) Report button state management** - Disable behavior after submission testing
- **(MANUAL) API endpoint testing** - Full request/response validation with real data
- **(MANUAL) Admin workflow testing** - End-to-end moderation process validation
- **(MANUAL) Integration tests** - Cross-service communication validation
- **(MANUAL) E2E testing** - Complete user journey from report to resolution
- **(MANUAL) Basic admin interface** - UI/UX design and usability testing
- **(MANUAL) User feedback systems** - Toast timing, message clarity, accessibility
- **(MANUAL) Authentication enforcement** - Security validation and permission testing

### üìã ESTIMATED EFFORT
- **Automatable Work**: ~85% of implementation tasks
- **Manual Validation**: ~15% focused on UX, security, and integration testing
- **Critical Manual Items**: Admin notifications, E2E testing, security validation
