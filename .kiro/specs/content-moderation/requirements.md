# Content Moderation - MVP Requirements

## User Story 1: Simple Reporting of Video Content

WHEN a user views a video challenge  
THEY SHALL see a "Report" button associated with each video  
WHEN the user taps "Report"  
THEN the system SHALL record a report tied to that video's unique ID  
AND generate an alert (e.g., database flag or email notification) to administrators  
AND provide user feedback acknowledging the report was received

## User Story 2: Administrative Handling

THE system SHALL provide an interface or data view for administrators to retrieve reported videos  
Administrators MAY manually review and mark videos for removal or retention  
Video removal MAY trigger deletion or disabling of the flagged video content

## Non-Goals for MVP

- Automatic or AI-driven content filtering or moderation  
- Sophisticated abuse detection or analysis  
- User block or ban flows  
- Self-service user dispute or appeal mechanisms
