## Implementation Notes

### User Database Schema
The users table includes:
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
- `email` (TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL)
- `password_hash` (TEXT NOT NULL)  
- `name` (TEXT) - Display name for creator attribution
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `is_active`, `last_login`

### Permission System
- Basic permissions: "media:read", "media:upload", "media:delete", "challenge:create", "challenge:read", "challenge:play"
- Admin permission: "admin" - grants access to all operations
- Rate limiting: 5 challenges per hour per user

### Token Management
- Access tokens expire in 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- Refresh tokens available for token renewal
- Guest tokens for anonymous users
- Secure storage with AsyncStorage

## No Further Implementation Required

The authentication system is production-ready and fully integrated with:
- Challenge creation (requires authentication)
- User attribution in challenge browser (shows real creator names)
- Rate limiting (5 challenges per hour)
- Guest user experience with seamless upgrade path
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
