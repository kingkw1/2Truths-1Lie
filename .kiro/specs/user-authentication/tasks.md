# User Authentication - MVP Implementation Tasks

## Implementation Status
**Backend**: ✅ Complete - Full authentication system with JWT, bcrypt, and Railway deployment  
**Mobile Service**: ✅ Complete - AuthService with guest user support and token management  
**Missing**: UI screens and navigation integration for signup/login flows

### Tasks Kiro Can Automate (UI Implementation, Integration, Testing)

- [ ] Create LoginScreen.tsx with email/password inputs, validation, and error handling
- [ ] Create SignupScreen.tsx with registration form, password confirmation, and client-side validation
- [ ] Integrate auth screens into existing React Navigation structure with proper routing
- [ ] Extend existing AuthService methods to support email/password authentication flows
- [ ] Create auth navigation guards and conditional rendering for authenticated vs guest users
- [ ] Generate form validation logic and error message display components
- [ ] Create loading states and user feedback for authentication operations
- [ ] Generate comprehensive UI tests for login/signup forms and authentication flows
- [ ] Update existing navigation patterns to include auth screen transitions
- [ ] Create auth state management integration with existing Redux store (if needed)

### Tasks To Perform Manually (UX Decisions, Design Polish, Testing)

- [ ] Design and finalize the visual design and styling for auth screens to match existing app aesthetics
- [ ] Determine optimal auth flow placement - modal vs full-screen vs bottom sheet presentation
- [ ] Decide on guest-to-authenticated user migration strategy and data preservation approach
- [ ] Test auth flows on physical iOS and Android devices for platform-specific behavior
- [ ] Validate auth error handling and recovery flows across different network conditions
- [ ] Review and test the complete user journey from guest → signup → authenticated game experience
- [ ] Configure any additional auth-related analytics and monitoring for user onboarding metrics
- [ ] Perform accessibility audit of auth forms for screen reader and keyboard navigation support
