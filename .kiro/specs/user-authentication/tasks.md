# User Authentication - MVP Implementation Tasks

### Tasks Kiro Can Automate (Spec-to-Code, Testing, API Generation)

- [ ] Generate User model with email (unique) and hashed password fields  
- [ ] Create REST API endpoints: `/signup` (POST), `/login` (POST) with validation and JWT response  
- [ ] Implement password hashing using bcrypt in backend service layer  
- [ ] Generate JWT signing and verification utilities  
- [ ] Create middleware for JWT validation on protected routes  
- [ ] Generate frontend login and signup screens with email/password inputs and client-side validation  
- [ ] Generate API client functions for signup and login flows  
- [ ] Create unit and integration tests for backend authentication and JWT flows  
- [ ] Generate basic UI tests for login/signup forms, error handling and successful login flows  

### Tasks To Perform Manually (Configuration, Deployment, Sensitive Setup)

- [ ] Configure JWT secret keys and environment variables securely in backend deployment  
- [ ] Choose and configure secure client storage mechanism for JWT (e.g., SecureStore on mobile)  
- [ ] Review generated code for security audit and compliance with data protection  
- [ ] Perform manual penetration testing for authentication endpoints  
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for backend auth failure rates or suspicious activity  
- [ ] Validate cross-platform UI and token persistence behavior on physical devices
