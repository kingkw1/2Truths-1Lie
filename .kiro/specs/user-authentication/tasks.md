# User Authentication - MVP Implementation Tasks

### Tasks Kiro Can Automate (Spec-to-Code, Testing, API Generation)

- [ ] Generate User data model with email (unique) and hashed password fields
- [ ] Create REST API endpoints: `POST /api/auth/signup` and `POST /api/auth/login` with request validation and JWT response
- [ ] Implement password hashing using bcrypt in the backend service layer
- [ ] Generate JWT signing and verification utility functions
- [ ] Create API middleware for JWT validation on protected routes
- [ ] Generate frontend login and signup screens with email/password inputs and client-side validation logic
- [ ] Generate API client functions for the signup and login flows on the mobile app
- [ ] Create unit and integration tests for the backend authentication logic and JWT flows
- [ ] Generate basic UI tests for the login/signup forms, error handling, and successful login navigation

### Tasks To Perform Manually (Configuration, Deployment, Sensitive Setup)

- [ ] Configure JWT secret keys and other sensitive environment variables securely in the backend deployment environment
- [ ] Choose and implement a secure client-side storage mechanism for the JWT (e.g., Expo's SecureStore)
- [ ] Perform a manual security audit and review of all generated authentication code
- [ ] Manually test the authentication endpoints for common vulnerabilities (e.g., using Postman or a similar tool)
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring and alerting for backend authentication failures
- [ ] Validate the cross-platform UI and token persistence behavior on physical iOS and Android devices
