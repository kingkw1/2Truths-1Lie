# Mobile User Authentication - MVP Requirements

## Current Implementation Status
**Note**: The project already has substantial authentication infrastructure in place, including backend auth services, JWT token management, and mobile auth client. This spec focuses on completing the missing UI/UX components and user registration flows.

## User Story: Account Creation

WHEN a new user provides a unique email and a valid password to the signup screen
THE SYSTEM SHALL create a new user account tied to that email

WHEN a new user provides an email that already exists in the system
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clear error message indicating the email is already in use

## User Story: User Login

WHEN a registered user provides their correct email and password to the login screen
THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the user successfully

WHEN a user provides an incorrect email or password
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clear error message for invalid credentials

## User Story: Session Management

WHEN a user successfully signs up or logs in
THE SYSTEM SHALL issue a JWT token for session authentication
AND the client application SHALL securely store this token

WHEN a user makes a request to a protected API endpoint with a valid JWT token
THE SYSTEM SHALL grant access

WHEN a user makes a request to a protected API endpoint with an invalid or missing JWT token
THE SYSTEM SHALL deny access with an unauthorized error

WHEN a user initiates a logout action
THE SYSTEM SHALL clear the stored JWT token from the client device

## User Story: Onboarding Integration

WHEN a user successfully signs up or logs in for the first time
THE SYSTEM SHALL navigate to the main game screen and maintain authentication state

WHEN an existing guest user decides to create an account
THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve their challenge history and migrate to authenticated account

## Non-Goals for MVP

- Biometric login
- Password reset or recovery flows  
- Email verification flows
- OAuth/Social login integration
