# Mobile User Authentication - MVP Requirements

## User Story: Account Creation

WHEN a new user provides a unique email and a valid password to the signup screen
THE SYSTEM SHALL create a new user account tied to that email

WHEN a new user provides an email that already exists in the system
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clear error message indicating the email is already in use

## User Story: User Login

WHEN a registered user provides their correct email and password to the login screen
THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the user successfully

WHEN a user provides an incorrect email or password
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clear error message for invalid credentials

## User Story: Session Management

WHEN a user successfully signs up or logs in
THE SYSTEM SHALL issue a JWT token for session authentication
AND the client application SHALL securely store this token

WHEN a user makes a request to a protected API endpoint with a valid JWT token
THE SYSTEM SHALL grant access

WHEN a user makes a request to a protected API endpoint with an invalid or missing JWT token
THE SYSTEM SHALL deny access with an unauthorized error

WHEN a user initiates a logout action
THE SYSTEM SHALL clear the stored JWT token from the client device

## Non-Goals for MVP

- Biometric login
- Password reset or recovery flows
- Email verification flows
