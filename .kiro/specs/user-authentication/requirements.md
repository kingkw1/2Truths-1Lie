# Mobile User Authentication - MVP Requirements

## User Story 1: Simple Email/Password Signup and Login

WHEN a user launches the app  
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow users to create an account using a unique email and password  
AND allow users to login with email and password  
AND provide clear error feedback for invalid credentials or duplicate emails  
AND assign each user a unique ID tied to their account

## User Story 2: Token-Based Session Management

THE SYSTEM SHALL use JWT tokens for session authentication  
AND securely store JWT tokens on the client side  
AND require valid token for access to protected API endpoints  
AND support logout by clearing client-side tokens

## Non-Goals for MVP (To Be Implemented Later)

- Biometric login (Touch ID, Face ID, fingerprint)  
- Password reset or recovery flows  
- Email verification or confirmation flows  
- Profile management or editing  
- Advanced security mechanisms like device detect, rate limiting
