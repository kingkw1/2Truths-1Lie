# Test Endpoints Removal Summary

## Task Completed
✅ **Remove or disable mock/test challenge endpoints to avoid confusion**

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Test Router in main.py
- **File**: `backend/main.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Commented out the import of `test_router` from `api.test_endpoints`
  - Commented out the `app.include_router(test_router)` line
  - Added explanatory comments indicating the endpoints were disabled to avoid confusion

### 2. Disabled Test Endpoints in test_endpoints.py
- **File**: `backend/api/test_endpoints.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added clear documentation at the top explaining the file is disabled
  - Set `router = None` to disable the router entirely
  - Commented out the `@router.post` decorator
  - Modified the endpoint function to return a 501 error with clear message
  - Added instructions for re-enabling if needed for development

## Verification
- ✅ Backend imports successfully without test endpoints
- ✅ No test routes are registered in the application
- ✅ Test router is properly set to None
- ✅ Production endpoints remain accessible (19 routes found)
- ✅ Python syntax validation passes for all modified files

## Impact
- **Positive**: Eliminates confusion between test and production challenge endpoints
- **Positive**: Prevents accidental use of mock endpoints that bypass validation
- **Positive**: Maintains clean separation between test and production code
- **Neutral**: Test endpoints can be easily re-enabled for development if needed

## Production Endpoints Still Available
The following production challenge endpoints remain fully functional:
- `POST /api/v1/challenges/` - Create challenge
- `GET /api/v1/challenges/` - List challenges  
- `GET /api/v1/challenges/{id}` - Get specific challenge
- `POST /api/v1/challenges/{id}/guess` - Submit guess
- `DELETE /api/v1/challenges/{id}` - Delete challenge
- And all other production endpoints

## Re-enabling Instructions (if needed for development)
To re-enable test endpoints for development purposes:
1. Uncomment the import and router inclusion in `main.py`
2. Uncomment the router definition and decorator in `test_endpoints.py`
3. Restore the original endpoint implementation
