### Contingency Video Plan (Demo/Prototype Version)

**Total Time: ~3 minutes**

---
## Part 1: The Showcase - "What We Built" (0:00 - 1:00)

* **Goal:** Get the judges excited about your app's core experience and potential, showcasing a high-quality, fun, and complete prototype.
* **Shots:**
    * (0:00-0:15) High-energy opening. Quick cuts of the app's most engaging moments: a user laughing while recording a lie, the "Correct!" screen after a good guess, friends swiping through challenges. Upbeat, fun music starts.
    * (0:15-1:00) A clear, concise "day in the life" demo of the core gameplay loop.
        * A user seamlessly records their three video clips. Highlight the fluid UI for retakes and previews.
        * Show the video uploading with a polished animation.
        * Demonstrate browsing challenges in a clean, swipe-able feed.
        * Show the process of watching a challenge and making a guess, culminating in the results screen.
* **Script:**
    * **(0:00-0:15)** "Welcome to 2Truths-1Lie, the social game where your creativity and deception are put to the test."
    * **(0:15-1:00)** "It's simple: create a challenge by recording two true statements and one lie, then try to spot the lie in other video challenges. Itâ€™s a fun, engaging, cross-platform experience designed to connect people through laughter and storytelling."

## Part 2: The Pivot - The "How We Built It" Transition (1:00 - 1:15)

* **Goal:** Create a powerful "Aha!" moment that connects the impressive prototype to the development process.
* **Shots:** The final screen of the app demo freezes and smoothly zooms out, revealing it was running in a mobile simulator next to a code editor.
* **Script:** "So, how did our small team build a **polished, full-stack prototype** with a complete cloud backend in just a few weeks? The answer is we didn't just write code; we architected it in partnership with our AI development environment, Kiro."

## Part 3: The Kiro Deep Dive (1:15 - 2:30)

* **Goal:** Show concrete examples of Kiro building the impressive features the judges just saw in the demo.
* **Shots & Script:** Fast-paced screen recordings of the development process.
    * **Spec-to-UI:** Side-by-side view. "Remember that slick video recorder? It started here, as a simple Kiro spec defining its entire structure and behavior, which Kiro then translated directly into code."
    * **AI-Powered Backend:** Show the Kiro chat. "That fast, reliable video processing on the backend? It was born from this conversation, where we described the API we needed and Kiro generated the robust Python code to power it."
    * **Future-Ready Hooks:** Showcase the hook files themselves inside the `/.kiro/hooks` directory. "We leveraged Kiro's spec-driven development for the core build. Looking ahead, we've also set up agent hooks to automate our testing and documentation. They're ready to be activated to ensure the app stays robust and easy to maintain as it evolves."

## Part 4: The Synthesis & Future Vision (2:30 - 3:00)

* **Goal:** Bring the story full circle, confidently positioning the current build as a successful foundation and clearly stating the next steps.
* **Shots:** Quick cuts between the polished app UI and the Kiro development environment. End with the "AI emotion recognition" mockups and a final title card with the project logo and GitHub URL.
* **Script:** "This is the power of modern, AI-assisted development. Kiro handled the heavy lifting, which gave us the time to focus on what matters: creativity and polish. **With this solid foundation built, our next steps are to implement the community features and prepare for a public launch.** This is 2Truths-1Lie, built with Kiro.
