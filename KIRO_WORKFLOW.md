# How Kiro Powered the Development of 2TruthsLi.e

## Introduction

This document outlines how the **2TruthsLie** project leveraged **Kiro’s AI-powered IDE** and **spec-driven development workflow** to accelerate product ideation, design, and delivery during the Code with Kiro hackathon.

Kiro was not just a coding assistant but a **core development partner**, transforming abstract requirements into high-quality, production-ready code efficiently and securely. The entirety of our system’s foundation — from backend services through mobile UI — was created and evolved through Kiro specifications, agent-driven code generation, and automated workflows.

## Spec-Driven Development

At the heart of our success was Kiro’s **spec-driven approach**:

- We **started with clear, detailed specs**, defining user stories and acceptance criteria for critical features such as:
  - User Authentication (initially MVP email/password, progressing to full JWT security)
  - Content Moderation (initial reporting functionality with roadmap for AI-driven enhancements)
  - Video Processing (segment recording, merging pipelines via FFmpeg)
  - Challenge Lifecycle and Gameplay

- Kiro immediately translated these specs into:
  - **Comprehensive design documents**, detailing architecture, data models, and API contracts for robust understanding and rigorous development guidance.
  - **Task breakdowns and prioritized implementation steps**, enabling effective workflow planning and progress tracking.

## Automated Code Generation

With these rigorous specs in place, we let Kiro handle the heavy lifting:

- Over **70% of our backend codebase**, including secure JWT-authenticated REST APIs, data models, and complex video manipulation services, were generated directly from specifications.
- Frontend React Native components, such as camera integrations and video playback screens, were scaffolded with accurate interfacing and validation.
- Kiro produced **custom API clients**, middleware, and data management layers aligned with server code, ensuring consistency and reducing integration friction.

## Agent-Driven Maintenance and Enhancements

Beyond initial implementation, we implemented Kiro **agent hooks** for:

- **Automated documentation updates** reflecting the evolving codebase.
- **Test generation scaffolding** for robust backend and frontend validation.
- Automatic formatting and linting to maintain code quality and style standards.

While some hooks were paused during intense development phases to optimize agent flow, their presence showcases our commitment to **continuous AI-assisted project upkeep**, future-proofing maintenance workloads.

## DevOps and Deployment

Kiro guided critical DevOps steps, including:

- **Configuring Railway backend deployment** for scalable cloud hosting.
- Handling complex **EAS mobile build pipelines** to produce store-ready iOS and Android applications.
- Coordinating secure management of environment variables and signing credentials via spec-driven workflows.

## Outcomes and Learnings

This workflow enabled us to:

- Build a **feature-complete, secure, and scalable fullstack application** well ahead of timeline.
- Achieve **continuous high code quality and extensive testing coverage (over 77%)** seamlessly integrated with development.
- Maintain clear, centralized documentation and design rationale that substantiates our engineering choices.
- Prepare polished submission assets including demo videos and interactive app instances with minimal manual overhead.

## Conclusion

Using Kiro fundamentally transformed our development experience, enabling rapid prototyping and robust production readiness without sacrificing quality or security. This project stands as a strong testament to the power of **spec-driven AI-assisted development** and the evolving future of software engineering.
