### Record Your Mobile App Like a Pro for Your Hackathon Video

Presenting a clear and professional video of your mobile app is crucial for making a strong impression at a hackathon. Here‚Äôs the best way to record on your mobile device and edit in DaVinci Resolve for a polished, widescreen final product.

### üì± Recording Your App Demonstration

Your primary goal is a crisp, clean recording of your app in action. Both iOS and Android have capable built-in screen recorders that are often the simplest and most reliable options.

**For iOS (iPhone/iPad):**

You can use the native screen recording tool. To ensure you also capture your voiceover explaining the app's features, you'll need to enable the microphone.

1.  **Add Screen Recording to Control Center:** Go to **Settings > Control Center** and tap the green "+" next to **Screen Recording**.
2.  **Start Recording with Audio:** Swipe down from the top-right corner of your screen to open the Control Center. Long-press the **Screen Recording** icon (a circle within a circle). Tap the **Microphone** icon to turn it on (it will turn red). Then, tap **Start Recording**.
3.  **Stop Recording:** A red bar or icon will appear at the top of your screen while recording. Tap it and then tap **Stop**. The recording will be saved to your Photos app.

**For Android:**

The process is similar, using the built-in screen recorder.

1.  **Access Quick Settings:** Swipe down from the top of your screen to reveal the Quick Settings panel.
2.  **Find the Screen Recorder:** Look for the "Screen recorder" or "Screen record" tile. You may need to swipe left or edit your tiles to find it.
3.  **Choose Your Audio Source:** Before starting, you'll likely have options for audio recording. Select "Microphone" or "Device audio and microphone" to record your voice.
4.  **Start and Stop:** Tap the screen recorder tile and a countdown will begin. To stop, tap the stop button on the floating toolbar or in your notification shade. The video will be saved to your gallery.

**Pro-Tip for Recording:**
* **Plan and script your demo.** Know exactly what you're going to show and say to avoid awkward pauses and mistakes. Keep it concise and focused on the most impressive features of your app.
* **Do a test recording.** This helps you check your audio levels and ensure the on-screen actions are clear.
* **Enable "Do Not Disturb" mode** to prevent notifications from interrupting your recording.

### üñ•Ô∏è Editing in DaVinci Resolve for a Widescreen Video

Since your final video will be in a standard widescreen format (16:9), you'll need a strategy to incorporate your vertical phone recording. Here‚Äôs a professional approach using DaVinci Resolve:

**1. Setting Up Your Project:**

* When you create a new project in DaVinci Resolve, ensure your timeline resolution is set to a standard widescreen format, such as **1920x1080 (HD)** or **3840x2160 (4K)**.

**2. Placing and Styling Your Mobile Recording:**

Simply placing the vertical video in the center of the widescreen frame will leave large black bars on the sides. Here are three creative and professional ways to fill that space:

* **The Blurred Background:** This is a popular and clean method.
    1.  Place your screen recording on the timeline on **Video Track 2**.
    2.  Duplicate the clip and place the copy on **Video Track 1**, directly below the original.
    3.  Select the clip on **Video Track 1** and, in the **Inspector** panel, increase the **Zoom** until it fills the entire frame.
    4.  In the **Effects** library, find the **Gaussian Blur** effect and drag it onto the clip on **Video Track 1**. Adjust the blur strength in the **Inspector** to your liking.

* **The Phone Mockup:** Placing your recording inside a phone frame makes it visually clear that you're demonstrating a mobile app.
    1.  Place your screen recording on the timeline.
    2.  Find a high-quality PNG image of a smartphone with a transparent screen area.
    3.  Import the phone image into your DaVinci Resolve media pool and place it on a video track **above** your screen recording.
    4.  Resize and position both the screen recording and the phone image so that your app footage fits perfectly within the phone's screen.

* **Side-by-Side Information:** Use the space to the sides of your phone recording to display valuable information.
    1.  Position your screen recording to one side of the frame.
    2.  On the other side, you can add:
        * **Text callouts** highlighting key features being shown.
        * **Your hackathon team logo** or the app's logo.
        * **A short video of you or your team members** speaking to the camera.



**DaVinci Resolve's "Auto Reframe" for Dynamic Shots:**

If you have other video content (like interviews with your team) that was shot vertically, you can use DaVinci Resolve's "Auto Reframe" feature to intelligently crop it for your widescreen timeline. Simply right-click the clip in the timeline and select **"Auto Reframe."**

By following these recording and editing techniques, you'll be well on your way to creating a compelling and professional hackathon submission video that effectively showcases your mobile app. Good luck!
