### Final Video Plan (Open Beta Launch Version with Curated Kiro Demo)

**Total Time: ~3 minutes**

---
## Part 1: The Showcase - "What We Built" (0:00 - 1:00)

* **Goal:** Get the judges excited about your app by showing it's a high-quality, community-ready, and complete social platform.
* **Shots:**
    * (0:00-0:15) High-energy opening. Quick cuts of the app's most engaging moments: a clean login/sign-up screen, a user laughing while recording a lie, friends swiping through challenges. Upbeat, fun music starts.
    * (0:15-1:00) A clear, concise "day in the life" demo.
        * Show a user signing in.
        * A user seamlessly records their three video clips. Highlight the fluid UI.
        * Show the video uploading with a polished animation.
        * Demonstrate browsing challenges. Briefly show a user profile icon next to a video and a subtle "report" button (e.g., a small flag icon).
        * Show the process of making a guess and the results screen.
* **Script:**
    * **(0:00-0:15)** "Welcome to 2Truths-1Lie, the social game where your creativity and deception are put to the test."
    * **(0:15-1:00)** "It's simple: join the community, create a challenge by recording two true statements and one lie, and try to spot the lie in videos from players around the world. It’s a fun, secure, and engaging cross-platform experience designed to connect people through laughter and storytelling."

## Part 2: The Pivot - The "How We Built It" Transition (1:00 - 1:15)

* **Goal:** Create a powerful "Aha!" moment that connects the impressive platform to the development process.
* **Shots:** The final screen of the app demo freezes and smoothly zooms out, revealing it was running in a mobile simulator next to a code editor.
* **Script:** "So, how did our small team build a secure, community-ready social platform with a full cloud backend in just a few weeks? The answer is we didn't just write code; we architected it in partnership with our AI development environment, Kiro."

## Part 3: The Kiro Deep Dive (1:15 - 2:30)

* **Goal:** Show concrete examples of Kiro building not just features, but critical, complex infrastructure.
* **Shots & Script:** Fast-paced screen recordings of the development process.
    * **Spec-to-UI:** Side-by-side view. "Remember that slick video recorder? It started here, as a simple Kiro spec defining its entire structure and behavior, which Kiro then translated directly into code."
    * **Curated Demo: Building the Secure Backend:**
        * **Shots:** **A tightly edited, time-lapsed screen recording of Kiro's chat interface. Show you pasting a clear, concise prompt for the authentication backend. As Kiro generates the code, it should appear on screen at a highly accelerated speed, conveying rapid automation. Use graphic highlights (boxes/arrows) to point to key generated elements like the registration endpoint, password hashing, or database interaction.**
        * **Script (Voiceover during the clip):** "Building a robust, secure authentication system is a critical, often time-consuming task. Instead, we simply described our requirements for user registration and login to Kiro. What you're seeing now is Kiro generating that complex, production-grade FastAPI backend code, complete with secure password hashing and database integration, in minutes—freeing us to focus on our unique game mechanics."
    * **Future-Ready Hooks:** Showcase the hook files themselves inside the `/.kiro/hooks` directory. "We leveraged Kiro's spec-driven development for the core build. Looking ahead, we've also set up agent hooks to automate our testing and documentation. They're ready to be activated to ensure the app stays robust and easy to maintain as it evolves."

## Part 4: The Synthesis & Future Vision (2:30 - 3:00)

* **Goal:** Bring the story full circle, emphasizing that Kiro enabled both the quality of the current app and its ambitious future.
* **Shots:** Quick cuts between the polished app UI and the Kiro development environment. End with the "AI emotion recognition" mockups and a final title card that includes the "Get it on Google Play" badge.
* **Script:** "This is the power of modern, AI-assisted development. Kiro handled the heavy lifting, which gave us the time to focus on what matters: creativity, polish, and thinking about what's next—like our plan for real-time lie detection. This is 2Truths-1Lie, built with Kiro. Check out our repo, and download the Open Beta today from the Google Play Store."
