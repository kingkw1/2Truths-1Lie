# Media Recording Deprecation Summary

## Task Completed: Deprecate standalone audio-only and text-only input modes, focusing on video with audio as primary recording modality

### Changes Made:

#### 1. MediaRecorder Component (`src/components/MediaRecorder.tsx`)
- **Removed standalone audio recording option** - audio is now only available as part of video recording
- **Updated UI to prioritize video recording** with a prominent primary button
- **Added fallback text option** for when video recording is not available
- **Simplified interface** - removed the multi-option type selection in favor of video-first approach
- **Updated messaging** to emphasize video with audio as the recommended option

#### 2. useMediaRecording Hook (`src/hooks/useMediaRecording.ts`)
- **Forced video-first approach** - all media recording attempts now try video with audio first
- **Removed standalone audio mode** - audio requests are converted to video requests
- **Enhanced fallback logic** - gracefully falls back to text mode when video is not supported
- **Removed Redux dependency** to make the hook more standalone and testable
- **Updated return values** to reflect video-only media mode

#### 3. StatementWithMedia Component (`src/components/StatementWithMedia.tsx`)
- **Updated to use video-first approach** in media recording integration
- **Changed button text** from "Add Media" to "Add Video" to be more specific
- **Updated allowed types** to only include video and text

#### 4. EnhancedChallengeCreationForm Component (`src/components/EnhancedChallengeCreationForm.tsx`)
- **Updated media support detection** to focus on video with audio
- **Removed standalone audio support indicators** from the UI
- **Updated status tracking** to show "Videos added" instead of "Media added"
- **Simplified available media types** to video and text only

#### 5. Demo Components
- **Updated EnhancedMediaRecorderDemo** to reflect video-first approach
- **Updated documentation and descriptions** to emphasize video recording

### Key Benefits:

1. **Simplified User Experience**: Users no longer need to choose between multiple recording modes
2. **Better Engagement**: Video with audio provides richer content for the game
3. **Consistent Fallback**: Text mode is always available when video recording fails
4. **Clearer Intent**: The interface now clearly communicates video as the primary option
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer code paths and UI states to maintain

### Fallback Behavior:

- **Primary**: Video recording with audio (recommended)
- **Fallback**: Text-only mode when video is not supported or permissions are denied
- **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback with clear user messaging

### Requirements Alignment:

This implementation aligns with:
- **Requirement 1**: Intuitive Core Game Loop - video with audio as primary, text as fallback
- **Requirement 8**: Media Capture - focuses on video recording as the main modality
- **Design Document**: Supports the video-first approach outlined in the design

### Testing:

- Build process completes successfully
- Components compile without errors
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing functionality
- Text fallback mode continues to work as expected

The implementation successfully deprecates standalone audio-only mode while maintaining a robust fallback system and improving the overall user experience by focusing on video with audio as the primary recording modality.
