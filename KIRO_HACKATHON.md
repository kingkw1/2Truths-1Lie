# Use of Kiro and Development Workflow

This project leverages a combination of AI assistance tools and human-driven development to build a robust and innovative “Two Truths and a Lie” game with multimodal emotion analysis. The key elements of the development process include:

- **Big-Picture Collaboration:**  
  I work closely with Gemini and Perplexity AI agents to discuss project goals, overall architecture, and feature design. Together, we develop comprehensive specification documents and a detailed testing plan that guide the entire development lifecycle.

- **Spec-Driven Task Execution with Kiro:**  
  Kiro is used primarily in *spec development mode* where it tackles discrete tasks derived from the specification documents. This includes generating implementation code, writing unit and integration tests, and assisting in iterative refinement of features. Kiro's task-focused assistance ensures alignment with the project roadmap and speeds up development through AI-driven code generation and validation.

- **Testing and Evaluation:**  
  Following the testing schedule defined in the testing plan, I continuously evaluate the project after the completion of major feature milestones. This helps maintain quality, stability, and adherence to hackathon requirements.

- **Debugging and Credit Optimization:**  
  To optimize Kiro credit usage and maintain efficiency, I use a mixed debugging approach. Manual debugging and local tooling are supplemented with Vibe Coding and Visual Studio Code Copilot as lightweight assistants for minor fixes or exploratory coding. This hybrid approach balances AI assistance with responsible credit management.

- **Transparency and Documentation:**  
  The Kiro execution logs and task histories are included in the `/.kiro` directory in this repository, demonstrating the AI-assisted development workflow central to this project. These artifacts provide insight into how Kiro was used to meet the project goals and hackathon criteria.

This approach combines the strengths of modern AI tools with experienced developer oversight to deliver a competitive, well-architected hackathon submission.
