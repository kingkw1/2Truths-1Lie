> **Shipaton Goal:** This project's journey for the Shipaton was to take a working app and answer the critical question: "How do you turn a fun idea into a sustainable business?" We focused on implementing a compelling core game loop and a thoughtful, user-first monetization model powered by RevenueCat.

## ✨ Core Features

* **🎥 Video-Based Gameplay:** The classic social game of deception, brought to life with short, user-created videos.
* **🏆 Persistent Scoring & Progression:** Correct guesses earn points that are tracked on your user profile. The game has real stakes!
* **🧩 Challenge Completion:** A dynamic feed that hides challenges you've already solved, ensuring a fresh experience every time.
* **✨ Premium Features:** A "Pro" subscription that unlocks valuable perks for our most dedicated players.
* **🪙 Consumable Hints:** Spendable "Tokens" provide a 50/50 hint to help you spot the lie.
* **🌙 Polished UI/UX:** A beautiful, responsive interface featuring a hand-tuned Dark Mode and satisfying haptic feedback.

## 💰 Monetization Model (for the HAMM Award)

We implemented a hybrid freemium model designed for player choice and long-term value, directly targeting the **HAMM (Help Apps Make Money) Award**.

* **Subscriptions ("Pro"):** Our monthly/yearly subscription is for power users. It unlocks unlimited challenge creation, provides a "Pro" status badge 🕵️, and grants a monthly stipend of Tokens.
* **Consumables ("Tokens"):** Any player can purchase packs of Tokens to spend on in-game "50/50" hints, allowing them to pay for meaningful moments of gameplay.

This strategy, powered by RevenueCat, provides a scalable foundation that respects free players while offering compelling value for users who wish to invest deeper in the game.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The system is a modern, full-stack application built for a production environment. For detailed technical documentation, see our [📚 Documentation Hub](docs/README.md).
