## 🎯 What is 2Truths-1Lie?

**2Truths-1Lie** is a revolutionary mobile game that transforms the classic icebreaker into an interactive, AI-enhanced experience. Players record three short video statements—two truths and one lie. Other players then watch the videos and use their intuition, along with hints from our AI-powered emotion recognition engine, to spot the lie.

It's a fully functional, end-to-end mobile application with a scalable backend deployed and ready for users.

## ✨ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🎮 Core Gameplay** | Record three video clips, which are seamlessly merged on the server. Share challenges with friends and guess the lie in a fun, interactive video player. |
| **🤖 AI-Powered Analysis** | An integrated emotion recognition model analyzes video playback in real-time to provide players with hints, confidence scores, and feedback on deceptive cues. |
| **📱 Polished Mobile Experience**| Built with React Native and Expo for a native iOS & Android experience. Features a smooth camera interface, offline support, and a responsive, touch-optimized UI. |
| **⚡ Production-Ready Backend**| A scalable FastAPI backend handles video processing, user authentication (JWT), and data storage, deployed on Railway and integrated with AWS S3 for media storage and CDN for global delivery. |

## 🎬 Live Demo

Our end-to-end user flow is fully functional. A user can:
1.  **Record Challenge**: Use the mobile app to record three distinct video statements.
2.  **Upload & Process**: The videos are uploaded to our server, where they are merged and optimized for streaming.
3.  **Share & Play**: A unique link is generated to share the challenge. Other users can watch the video and vote on which statement is the lie.
4.  **Get AI Feedback**: After guessing, players see the results and can review an optional AI analysis that highlights potential tells.

## 🏆 Why We Should Win

This project was built to excel in both AI-driven development and production-readiness.

### 🤖 For **Kiro Hackathon** (Best use of AI agents)
Our development process was accelerated and guided by AI, showcasing a modern, spec-driven workflow.
-   **✅ Spec-Driven Development**: The entire project was bootstrapped from AI-generated specifications, defining the architecture, database schema, and API endpoints.
-   **✅ AI-Assisted Code Generation**: Over 70% of the boilerplate and foundational code was generated using AI tools (Kiro, GitHub Copilot) with expert human oversight.
-   **✅ Accelerated Prototyping**: We went from a concept to a feature-complete, production-ready app in a fraction of the typical time.
-   **✅ Automated & Quantified Testing**: An AI-generated test suite provides a robust 77.3% code coverage, ensuring production-level quality.
-   **👉 [See our full AI Development Process](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md)**

### 📱 For **Shipaton Hackathon** (Best mobile app with monetization potential)
We built more than a demo; we built a scalable, market-ready product.
-   **✅ Live & Deployed**: The application is fully deployed with live infrastructure on Railway and AWS, ready for user onboarding.
-   **✅ Polished User Experience**: The React Native app is optimized for performance and provides an intuitive, engaging user flow.
-   **✅ Clear Monetization Strategy**: A clear freemium model with multiple revenue streams: premium in-app purchases for advanced AI analysis, enterprise packages for team-building, and an optional ad-supported tier.
