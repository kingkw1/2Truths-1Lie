### **Session 1: All Phone Screen Recordings (The Core App Demo)**

**Goal:** Capture every piece of mobile app footage in one go. This is the bulk of your visual content.
**Setup:** Your phone, screen recording software, and ensure the app is in a clean state (logged out, no old challenges cluttering the feed).

**Recording Checklist (Record these as separate, long takes):**

1.  **"Golden Path" Full Walkthrough (For Parts 1 & 4):**
    * **What to Record:** Start your recording. Go through the *entire* user journey slowly and deliberately:
        * Show the Login Screen.
        * Log in.
        * Navigate to "Create Challenge."
        * Record three distinct video segments (make them real and fun!).
        * Submit the challenge and let the upload animation play.
        * Go to the main feed and scroll to find a different challenge.
        * Open the challenge, watch the videos, and make a guess.
        * Show the "Correct!" or "Fooled You!" results screen.
    * **Why:** This single, long take will provide the raw footage for **Shots 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and the start of Shot 18**. By recording it all at once, you ensure visual consistency and don't have to keep resetting the app's state.

2.  **"Beauty Shots" & Specifics (For Montages):**
    * **What to Record:** After the main walkthrough, record a few more specific actions for your montages:
        * **Fast Swiping:** Just open the feed and swipe up and down quickly for 15-20 seconds[cite: 1]. This is for the speed ramp in **Shot 3**.
        * **UI Details:** Slowly hover over and tap specific UI elements you want to highlight, like the "Report" button. This will give you clean footage for the callouts in **Shot 8**.
        * **Future Vision Base:** Record a clean, 15-second clip of you slowly scrolling the main feed[cite: 1]. This will be the background for your animated mockups in **Shot 17**.

### **Session 2: All PC Screen Recordings (The Kiro Deep Dive)**

**Goal:** Capture all the "behind-the-scenes" Kiro footage.
**Setup:** Your PC with OBS. Open your Kiro IDE, your terminal, and have your spec files ready in separate tabs. Make sure your desktop is clean and free of distractions.

**Recording Checklist:**

1.  **Spec-to-UI Footage (For Shot 13):**
    * **What to Record:** With OBS, record yourself setting up the split screen. Have the Kiro spec file (`requirements.md` or `design.md` for the recorder) on the left and the Android simulator running the video recorder UI on the right[cite: 1]. Just let it sit there for about 20 seconds. You'll add all the animation in post-production.

2.  **Curated Backend Demo (For Shot 14):**
    * **What to Record:** This is your most important recording. Follow the plan exactly:
        * Start recording with the Kiro chat interface full-screen.
        * Paste in your perfected prompt for the authentication backend[cite: 1].
        * Let Kiro generate the entire block of code[cite: 1]. Don't worry about how long it takes; we will time-lapse it heavily in the edit. Just let it finish.

3.  **AI-Generated Testing Footage (For Shot 15):**
    * **What to Record:** Similar to the Spec-to-UI shot.
        * Record a split screen with the Kiro spec file for tests on the left and the generated Jest test file on the right[cite: 1]. Hold for 20 seconds.
        * Switch to a full-screen terminal window. Run the test command (`npm test` or similar) and record the entire process of the tests running and finally passing with the green "PASS" message[cite: 1].

4.  **"The Reveal" Footage (For Shots 11 & 12):**
    * **What to Record:** This is the zoom-out shot.
        * Start with the Android simulator full-screen in OBS.
        * Slowly and smoothly, use OBS's scene controls or your editing software to zoom out, revealing the code editor next to it. Hold the final composition for about 15 seconds.

### **Session 3: All Live Action Footage**

**Goal:** Capture the human element.
**Setup:** Your phone (for filming) or another camera. Good lighting is keyâ€”sit facing a window for natural light.

**Recording Checklist:**

1.  **The "User" Reaction (Shot 2):**
    * **What to Film:** Film your wife watching a funny video on her phone (it doesn't have to be your app!) and capture a genuine laugh or smile[cite: 1]. Film more than you need so you can pick the best take.

2.  **The "Creator" Interaction (Shot 16):**
    * **What to Film:** Film yourself interacting with the app, either recording a new challenge or playing one[cite: 1].

3.  **The "Spec" Interaction (Shot 16):**
    * **What to Film:** Print out a page from one of your Kiro spec files. Film a close-up of your hand pointing to a specific, important-looking line on the paper[cite: 1]. This is a quick, tangible shot that will cut well in the montage.
