### **Session 1: All Phone Screen Recordings (The Core App Demo)**

**Goal:** Capture every piece of mobile app footage in one go. This is the bulk of your visual content for the video.
**Setup:** Your physical Android phone with the final, polished build of the app. Use the native Android screen capture tool. Ensure the app is in a clean state for each take (logged out, test user data is reset if needed).

**Recording Checklist (Record these as separate, clean takes):**

1.  **The "Free User" Monetization Flow:**
    * **What to Record:** Log in as a **non-premium** user.
        * Show the challenge creation screen with the rate limit message.
        * Attempt to create challenges until you are blocked by the rate limit.
        * Show the paywall modal that appears.
        * Navigate to the full Store screen.
        * Tap the "Annual (Best Value)" option.
        * Tap the "Start 7-Day Free Trial" button and complete the Google Play purchase flow.
    * **Why:** This single take provides the crucial footage for the first half of **Shot 6** and demonstrates the core monetization gate.

2.  **The "Premium User" Golden Path:**
    * **What to Record:** Log in as a **premium** user (the one who just "subscribed" in the take above).
        * Start on the Home screen. Show the "Pro" badge (üïµÔ∏è) and the user's score (üèÜ).
        * Navigate to the "Create Challenge" screen. Show the "unlimited creations" message.
        * Quickly record three video segments.
        * Submit the challenge.
        * Navigate to the main feed, find a challenge, and make a **correct guess**.
        * Show the smooth "Correct!" animation and the points awarded.
        * Navigate back to the home screen and show the score has increased.
        * Pull-to-refresh the feed to show the completed challenge is now gone.
    * **Why:** This long take provides the core gameplay footage for **Shot 4**, **Shot 5**, and the second half of **Shot 6**.

3.  **"Beauty Shots" for Montages:**
    * **What to Record:** Record a few specific, isolated actions:
        * **Fast Swiping:** Open the feed and scroll up and down quickly for 15 seconds. This is for **Shot 2**.
        * **Dark Mode Toggle:** Go to the Account screen and cleanly toggle Dark Mode on and off. This is for **Shot 2**.
        * **Haptic Pulse:** Slowly tap a major button where you've implemented haptics. In editing, you'll add a visual pulse effect to this shot. This is for **Shot 2**.
        * **Token Spending:** Go into a challenge and use the "Use Hint" feature. This is for **Shot 7**.
    * **Why:** These short, clean clips are perfect for the high-energy montages and for showcasing specific polish features.

### **Session 3: AI Video Generation & Live Action**

**Goal:** Capture the high-impact creative and human elements.
**Setup:** Your camera/phone for filming (good lighting is key!) and your Google Pro account for video generation.

**Recording Checklist:**

1.  **AI-Generated Video Clips (For Shot 8):**
    * **What to Generate:** Use your Google Pro video suite to generate the three short, abstract clips we planned.
        * **Prompt 1:** "An abstract animation of glowing red database servers with connection error symbols, dark and cinematic."
        * **Prompt 2:** "An abstract animation of glowing lines of text and code flowing between a human icon and a brain icon, on a dark blue background."

    * **Why:** This is a fast way to create stunning visuals that make your development story dynamic and memorable.

2.  **The Live Action "Bookends":**
    * **What to Film:**
        * **The Opening Reaction (Shot 2):** Film your wife watching something funny on her phone and capture a genuine laugh or smile. Get a few takes to choose from.
        * **The Closing Scene (Shot 10):** Film a short, 10-15 second clip of you and your wife on the couch, passing the phone back and forth, smiling and playing the game together.
