### Part 1: The Showcase - "What We Built" (0:00 - 1:00)

**Overall Vibe:** Energetic, polished, fun, and professional. The music should be upbeat and modern (royalty-free synth-pop or indie pop is a great choice). The editing should be crisp and fast-paced in the opening, then slow down for the demonstration.

---
#### **Section 1.1: High-Energy Opening (0:00 - 0:15)**

This is a rapid montage designed to generate excitement and showcase the app's professional quality.

* **Shot 1: Title Card**
    * **Timecode:** 0:00 - 0:03
    * **Visuals:** A clean, professionally designed title card. Use DaVinci Resolve's Fusion or PowerPoint to create a graphic with your app's logo, the title **"2Truths-1Lie,"** and a subtitle below it: "A Kiro-Powered Social Game."
    * **Editing:** Start with a fade in from black. Add a subtle animated effect, like the text sliding or fading into place.
    * **Audio:** Upbeat, modern, royalty-free music starts with a subtle "whoosh" sound effect as the title appears.
    * **Script:** *(No voiceover yet)*

* **Shot 2: The Human Connection**
    * **Timecode:** 0:03 - 0:06
    * **Visuals:** **Live Action.** A well-lit, close-up shot of your wife looking down at a phone (just out of frame) and genuinely laughing or smiling in surprise. This immediately connects the app to a real human emotion.
    * **Editing:** Use a J-cut—the voiceover should start *just before* this shot appears, creating a smooth audio transition. Hard cut to this shot from the title card.
    * **Audio:** Music continues. **VO starts:** "Welcome to 2Truths-1Lie..."

* **Shot 3: The App in Action (Fast Pace)**
    * **Timecode:** 0:06 - 0:09
    * **Visuals:** **Phone Screen Recording (OBS/Phone).** A fast-paced shot of a user quickly swiping through the main challenge feed. The goal is to show a vibrant, content-rich environment.
    * **Editing:** Use a speed ramp in DaVinci Resolve. Start at normal speed for a fraction of a second, rapidly speed up the scroll, then slow it down into the next shot. Add a touch of motion blur to enhance the sense of speed.
    * **Audio:** Music continues to drive the pace. VO continues: "...the social game where your creativity..."

* **Shot 4: The Payoff**
    * **Timecode:** 0:09 - 0:12
    * **Visuals:** **Phone Screen Recording.** A clean, direct shot of the "Correct!" or "Fooled You!" results screen. Capture the moment the celebratory animation plays.
    * **Editing:** A slight, quick "zoom punch" effect on the screen to add impact and energy.
    * **Audio:** Add a satisfying "chime" or "sparkle" sound effect that syncs with the animation. VO finishes the line: "...and deception are put to the test."

* **Shot 5: AI-Generated Visual Polish**
    * **Timecode:** 0:12 - 0:15
    * **Visuals:** **Google Veo.** Generate a short, abstract clip. **Prompt Idea:** "An abstract animation of glowing social connection lines moving between minimalist phone icons, on a dark background with blue and violet colors."
    * **Editing:** A quick cross-dissolve from the results screen to this abstract shot. Overlay clean, bold text using DaVinci Resolve that says: "**Now in Open Beta**".
    * **Audio:** Music hits a clear beat or punctuation point to end the intro montage.

---
#### **Section 1.2: "Day in the Life" Demo (0:15 - 1:00)**

The pace slows down here. The music volume drops slightly, and the editing becomes clean and deliberate to let the voiceover and app functionality take center stage.

* **Shot 6: Join & Create**
    * **Timecode:** 0:15 - 0:25
    * **Visuals:** **Phone Screen Recording.** Start on the clean login screen. Show a single tap to sign in (no need to show typing). Smoothly transition to the "Create Challenge" screen. Show a finger tapping to record the first video segment; let it record for 2-3 seconds.
    * **Editing:** Use simple, clean cuts. You can add a subtle graphical pulse/highlight effect on the buttons as they are tapped.
    * **Audio:** Music volume lowers. **VO starts:** "It's simple: join the community, create a challenge by recording two true statements and one lie..."

* **Shot 7: Upload & Process**
    * **Timecode:** 0:25 - 0:35
    * **Visuals:** **Phone Screen Recording.** Cut to after the third video has been recorded. Show the user tapping the "Submit" button. Let the polished upload animation play out for a few seconds to showcase its quality.
    * **Editing:** No fancy edits needed here. The focus is on the smooth, professional animation you built.
    * **Audio:** Add a subtle, modern "upload" or "data stream" sound effect. VO continues: "...and try to spot the lie in videos from players around the world."

* **Shot 8: Browse & See Community Features**
    * **Timecode:** 0:35 - 0:48
    * **Visuals:** **Phone Screen Recording.** The upload completes, transitioning to the main challenge feed. Slowly scroll down the feed. Pause on one challenge card.
    * **Editing:** Use DaVinci Resolve to add simple, clean graphical callouts (like a glowing circle or a small arrow) that briefly appear to point to a user's profile icon and the "report" flag icon as the voiceover says the word "secure." This is a key visual proof point.
    * **Audio:** Music continues steadily. VO continues: "It’s a fun, **secure**, and engaging cross-platform experience..."

* **Shot 9: Guess & Result**
    * **Timecode:** 0:48 - 1:00
    * **Visuals:** **Phone Screen Recording.** The user taps on a challenge. Use quick cuts to show the three video segments playing briefly. Show the user tapping their guess. Cut immediately to the "Correct!" results screen.
    * **Editing:** Hold on the results screen for the final few seconds. A gentle, slow zoom-in can add a touch of polish.
    * **Audio:** Another satisfying "chime" SFX on the result. The voiceover finishes: "...designed to connect people through laughter and storytelling." The music swells slightly at the end to lead into the next part of the video.

### Part 2: The Pivot - "The How We Built It" Transition (1:00 - 1:15)

**Overall Vibe:** A "reveal" or an "aha!" moment. The energy from the upbeat demo pauses for a moment of reflection. The music should shift from the main melody to a more ambient, thoughtful bridge or a simple held synth chord. The editing is smooth and deliberate.

---
#### **The Shot Plan**

* **Shot 10: The Freeze Frame**
    * **Timecode:** 1:00 - 1:02
    * **Visuals:** This shot begins with the final frame from Part 1: the "Correct!" results screen on the phone.
    * **Editing:** In DaVinci Resolve, freeze the last frame of the phone screen recording. The image should be perfectly still.
    * **Audio:** The upbeat music from Part 1 fades out, leaving either a single sustained synth note or a moment of near-silence. A subtle "camera shutter" or "click" sound effect can be used to punctuate the freeze.
    * **Script:** *(No voiceover yet, let the freeze hang for a moment)*

* **Shot 11: The Reveal**
    * **Timecode:** 1:02 - 1:08
    * **Visuals:** **Screen Recording (OBS).** The frozen phone screen begins to smoothly zoom out. As it pulls back, it reveals that the "phone" is actually an Android simulator running on your PC. To the side of the simulator, your code editor (VS Code/Kiro IDE) is visible, showing a relevant file like `GameScreen.tsx`.
    * **Editing:** This should be a single, smooth, slow zoom-out animation. This is a key visual effect. You can create this easily in DaVinci Resolve by keyframing the scale and position of the screen recording clip. Make sure the code in the editor is clean and aesthetically pleasing.
    * **Audio:** The ambient synth note holds. The voiceover begins here, speaking slowly and deliberately to build intrigue. **VO starts:** "So, how did our small team build a secure, community-ready social platform with a full cloud backend in just a few weeks?"

* **Shot 12: The Answer**
    * **Timecode:** 1:08 - 1:15
    * **Visuals:** Continue the slow zoom out. As the voiceover says the word "Kiro," a graphical element appears.
    * **Editing:** Use DaVinci Resolve to add a subtle but clean graphic overlay. The Kiro logo could fade in next to the code editor. Alternatively, you could have a glowing highlight appear around the Kiro-specific UI elements of the IDE.
    * **Audio:** A subtle, low-frequency "thump" or "bass swell" sound effect should punctuate the appearance of the Kiro logo, timed exactly with the voiceover saying "Kiro." The voiceover finishes the line. **VO finishes:** "The answer is we didn't just write code; we architected it in partnership with our AI development environment, Kiro." The ambient music then begins to build slightly, leading into the next section.

### Part 3: The Kiro Deep Dive (1:15 - 2:30)

**Overall Vibe:** Insightful, impressive, and fast-paced. The music should shift to something more focused and slightly more electronic, suggesting technology and innovation. The editing will use split screens and graphical callouts to direct the viewer's attention.

---
#### **Section 3.1: Spec-to-UI (1:15 - 1:30)**

This segment connects a polished feature the judges just saw to its origin in a Kiro spec file.

* **Shot 13: The UI Rewind & Split Screen**
    * **Timecode:** 1:15 - 1:30
    * **Visuals:** **Screen Recording (OBS) & Pre-prepared Graphics.**
        1.  Start with a full-screen recording of the slick video recorder UI from the mobile app.
        2.  Have the video "rewind" with a visual effect, then shrink to the right side of the screen.
        3.  As it shrinks, a screen recording of the corresponding Kiro spec file (`requirements.md` or `design.md` for the recorder) slides in from the left, creating a side-by-side view.
    * **Editing:** In DaVinci Resolve, use graphical highlights that animate on screen. First, a box appears around a specific requirement in the spec file (e.g., "THE SYSTEM SHALL allow for three distinct video segments"). Then, an animated line should draw across the screen, connecting that text to the corresponding UI element on the right.
    * **Audio:** The new, focused music begins. A few subtle "tech" sound effects (clicks, data sounds) can be used as the graphics animate. **VO starts:** "Remember that slick video recorder? It started here, as a simple Kiro spec defining its entire structure and behavior, which Kiro then translated directly into code."

---
#### **Section 3.2: Curated Demo - Building the Secure Backend (1:30 - 1:55)**

This is your "power move"—the live demonstration that proves Kiro's capability on a critical, complex task.

* **Shot 14: The Curated Kiro Demo**
    * **Timecode:** 1:30 - 1:55
    * **Visuals:** **Screen Recording (OBS).** This is the pre-recorded, tightly edited clip.
        1.  Start with a full-screen view of the Kiro IDE chat interface.
        2.  Show the detailed prompt for the authentication backend being pasted in.
        3.  Transition to the time-lapsed view of Kiro generating the Python code. The code should scroll by rapidly to convey speed.
    * **Editing:** This is the most important editing sequence.
        1.  The time-lapse must be aggressive (10x-20x speed).
        2.  As the code generates, use DaVinci Resolve to add clear graphic callouts (arrows or boxes) that pause briefly on key generated sections (like the `POST /api/auth/signup` endpoint or the `bcrypt` password hashing line) while the rest of the code continues to generate in the background.
        3.  The final shot should show the complete, generated Python file.
    * **Audio:** The music continues with a driving, focused beat. **VO (perfectly timed to the visuals):** "Building a robust, secure authentication system is a critical, often time-consuming task. Instead, we simply described our requirements for user registration and login to Kiro. What you're seeing now is Kiro generating that complex, production-grade FastAPI backend code, complete with secure password hashing and database integration, in minutes—freeing us to focus on our unique game mechanics."

---
#### **Section 3.3: AI-Generated Testing (1:55 - 2:30)**

This segment closes the loop, showing that Kiro helps with quality and stability, not just speed.

* **Shot 15: The Proof of Quality**
    * **Timecode:** 1:55 - 2:30
    * **Visuals:** **Screen Recording (OBS) & Pre-prepared Graphics.**
        1.  Start with a split screen similar to Shot 13. On the left, show a Kiro spec file for tests. On the right, show the generated Jest test file (`*.test.tsx`).
        2.  Animate a highlight moving from a requirement in the spec to a corresponding `it(...)` block in the test file.
        3.  Transition to a full-screen shot of a terminal window where the tests are running and passing, with the final "PASS" and test count clearly visible.
    * **Editing:** Hold on the final "PASS" message. Use DaVinci Resolve to add a bold text overlay that says **"200+ Automated Tests"** to emphasize the scale.
    * **Audio:** The music reaches a crescendo and then holds, creating a sense of accomplishment. **VO:** "And it wasn't just about building features. Kiro also generated a comprehensive test suite directly from our specs, giving us over 200 tests that verify our authentication and core logic, ensuring the app was secure and stable from day one." The music then begins to transition to a more inspirational, forward-looking tone for the final part.

### Part 4: The Synthesis & Future Vision (2:30 - 3:00)

**Overall Vibe:** Inspirational, visionary, and a strong call to action. The music should swell to its most uplifting and conclusive theme. The editing will use quick, rhythmic cuts to build a final montage that summarizes the project's journey and success.

---
#### **The Shot Plan**

* **Shot 16: The Synthesis Montage**
    * **Timecode:** 2:30 - 2:42
    * **Visuals:** A revised, rapid-fire montage with a clearer, escalating rhythm: **Plan -> Result -> Plan -> Result -> The Tangible Plan -> The Quality Proof -> The Human Payoff.**
        * **Cut 1 (1.5s):** Screen recording of the Kiro spec file for the video recorder.
        * **Cut 2 (1.5s):** The polished video recorder UI in the app.
        * **Cut 3 (1.5s):** Screen recording of the Kiro spec file for the backend.
        * **Cut 4 (1.5s):** The app successfully showing the upload animation.
        * **Cut 5 (2s):** **The Consolidated Live-Action Shot.** A single, clean, impactful shot of your hand decisively tapping or underlining a key line on **one** of the printed-out spec sheets. This one shot now powerfully represents the entire "spec-driven" concept.
        * **Cut 6 (1s):** A quick shot of the Kiro-generated test files.
        * **Cut 7 (3s):** **Live Action.** A longer shot of you or your wife genuinely smiling and enjoying the final product.
    * **Editing:** Still rhythmic and timed to the music. The new flow is more powerful: you establish the "spec-to-product" pattern twice, then provide the memorable, tangible shot of the physical spec, followed by the proof of quality (tests), and ending on the emotional payoff (a person enjoying the game).
    * **Audio:** The music swells, and the voiceover remains the same, as it perfectly complements this new visual sequence.
        * **VO starts:** "This is the power of modern, AI-assisted development. Kiro handled the heavy lifting, which gave us the time to focus on what matters: creativity, polish..."

* **Shot 17: The Future Vision**
    * **Timecode:** 2:42 - 2:50
    * **Visuals:** Use a "picture-in-picture" or split-screen effect. On the main part of the screen, show the clean recording of your app's feed. In a smaller, clean box overlaid on top, show the most compelling clip from your previous project's real-time emotion recognition display.
    * **Editing:** Animate the emotion recognition box to fade in smoothly as you begin the voiceover line. You can add a subtle glowing border to it. This clearly communicates "this technology" plus "this app."
    * **VO :** "...and thinking about what's next—like integrating **our proven emotion recognition engine** for real-time lie detection." The word "proven" is key and is backed up by the visual evidence on screen.

* **Shot 18: The Final Call to Action**
    * **Timecode:** 2:50 - 3:00
    * **Visuals:** **Final Title Card.** This should be your most polished graphic.
        * App Logo: "2Truths-1Lie"
        * Tagline: "Built with Kiro"
        * GitHub Repo URL: `github.com/kingkw1/2Truths-1Lie`
        * The "Get it on Google Play" badge.
        * Slightly ghosted-out Apple App Store badge with the text "Coming Soon" next to it
        * The QR code you generated.
    * **Editing:** Start on a quick shot of the app's home screen, then have it smoothly transition or fade into this final, clean title card. Hold on the card for the last few seconds.
    * **Audio:** The music hits its final, triumphant chord and fades out. **VO finishes:** "This is 2Truths-1Lie, built with Kiro. Check out our repo, and download the Open Beta today from the Google Play Store."
