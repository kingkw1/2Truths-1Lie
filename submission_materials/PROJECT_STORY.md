# Project Story: 2 Truths & a Lie

### Our Inspiration

At its core, **2 Truths & a Lie** was inspired by the timeless social game where players share authentic stories to challenge and connect with friends. We wanted to capture that magic in a modern, digital experience, creating a platform where a global community could interact through the simple joy of storytelling, laughter, and a little bit of deception.

Our app lets users record three short video statementsâ€”two truths and one lieâ€”which the community then watches and votes on to guess the lie.

### How We Built It: A Partnership with Kiro

Our goal was to build a production-grade application, not just a prototype. To achieve this, we fully embraced **Kiroâ€™s AI-powered, spec-driven development workflow** from day one.

Instead of writing boilerplate, we invested our time in creating detailed specifications for each core feature in our `/.kiro/specs/` directory. We treated these specs as the source of truth, allowing Kiro to translate our architectural decisions directly into code.

> Kiro automatically generated **over 70% of our foundational code**, including the entire **secure FastAPI backend with JWT authentication** and the complex **React Native video recording UI**. This partnership accelerated our development velocity by an estimated 3x, allowing us to focus on what truly matters: the user experience.

### Challenges We Faced

Building a media-rich social app comes with significant technical hurdles. Our main challenges included:
* Orchestrating multi-segment video capture to ensure flawless, "no-bleed" playback transitions.
* Engineering a robust, server-side video merging pipeline with **FFmpeg** that could scale.
* Ensuring production-grade stability and security across the full stack, from the mobile app to the deployed **Railway** backend.

We navigated these challenges by pairing Kiro's automated code generation with rigorous human oversight and a comprehensive test suite.

### Key Accomplishments & Learnings

We are incredibly proud to have delivered a **fully operational, scalable, and polished mobile social game** ready for its Open Beta launch. Our key accomplishments include:

* A secure FastAPI backend, architected and generated through Kiro specs.
* A responsive, cross-platform mobile app with **a 90% pass rate across over 240 tests**.
* Successful deployment to a production environment on Railway.

> **What We Learned:** Our biggest takeaway was the power of a specification-first mindset. We learned firsthand that by investing time in detailed requirements upfront, an AI partner like Kiro can dramatically accelerate delivery without compromising quality or security. This project proved that speed and stability are not mutually exclusive in modern development.

### Whatâ€™s Next for 2 Truths & a Lie

We're excited about the future of the project and plan to continue our AI-driven collaboration. Our roadmap includes:
* Enhancing content moderation with AI-driven detection tools.
* Introducing personalization features and smart recommendations.
* Rolling out monetization through RevenueCat-powered subscriptions.
* Expanding platform parity with full iOS support.
