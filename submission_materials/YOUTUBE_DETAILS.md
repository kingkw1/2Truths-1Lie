Presenting "2Truths-1Lie," our submission for the Code with Kiro Hackathon. This is a fully functional, AI-enhanced mobile social game built from the ground up using Kiro's spec-driven development workflow.

In the game, players create engaging video-based challenges by recording two true statements and one lie. The community then watches and votes to guess the lie, fostering genuine storytelling and social connection.

ü§ñ **HOW WE BUILT IT WITH KIRO** ü§ñ
This project is a testament to a modern development workflow where an AI is a true architectural partner. Kiro was used throughout the entire process:

* **Spec-Driven Development:** We created detailed specs for every major feature, from User Authentication to Content Moderation and Video Processing. These specs served as the source of truth for the AI.
* **Automated Code Generation:** Kiro generated over 70% of our foundational code, including the entire production-grade FastAPI backend with secure password hashing. 
* **Automated Testing:** Kiro also generated a comprehensive test suite of over 200 tests directly from our specs, ensuring the application was secure and stable from day one. 

This AI-assisted process allowed us to go from an idea to a polished, production-ready application within the hackathon timeline.
