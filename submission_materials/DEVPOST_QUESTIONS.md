#### **For the HAMM Award (Help Apps Make Money)**

> 2Truths-1Lie uses a hybrid freemium model designed to maximize player choice and long-term value, which is a key part of our strategy for the **HAMM (Help Apps Make Money) Award**. Our core belief is that a compelling game loop must exist first, making the premium features feel like a true enhancement, not a requirement.
>
> * **Subscriptions ("Pro"):** Our monthly/yearly subscription is for our most engaged users. It unlocks unlimited challenge creation and provides tangible rewards like a "Pro" status badge and a monthly stipend of our virtual currency ("Tokens").
>
> * **Consumables ("Tokens"):** For players who want to gain a competitive edge in a specific moment, Tokens can be purchased and spent on a "50/50" lie-detection hint. This allows users to pay for meaningful moments of gameplay.
>
> This dual-pronged strategy, powered by RevenueCat, provides a scalable foundation that respects free players while offering compelling value for those who wish to invest deeper in the game.

#### **For the #BuildInPublic Award (Description)**

> Our entire Shipaton journey was documented on X and Devpost. We believe in transparency and that the struggles of development are as important to share as the successes. This philosophy is core to our entry for the **#BuildInPublic Award**.
>
> We shared our strategic pivot from a cross-platform launch to an Android-only focus, and received community encouragement. When we were stuck for days on a critical video playback bug, we shared the frustrating process. This open approach not only kept us accountable but also made the final solution feel like a shared victory. Our AI development partnership was another key part of our public story, showing how modern tools can accelerate a solo developer's workflow.

#### **For the Best Vibes Award**
> Our submission was powered by a multi-layered AI development team, a core part of our strategy for the **Best Vibes Award**.
>
> We used **Google Gemini** and **Perplexity** as our "AI Project Managers and Architects." They were essential for high-level strategy, such as refining our "Final Weekend Battle Plan" and making the critical pivot to an Android-only submission. Most importantly, we collaborated with them to craft the detailed, expert-level prompts that we then passed to our "AI Developers"—Google Jules and VSC Copilot.
>
> This workflow was a lifesaver. When we hit a multi-day, show-stopping bug with our backend testing environment, we used Gemini and Perplexity to diagnose the root cause and formulate a new, robust testing strategy. They then helped us write a precise, step-by-step prompt, which we passed to Jules to execute the complex refactor.
>
> This AI partnership allowed a solo developer to tackle massive technical challenges without getting bogged down or discouraged, maintaining a positive and productive "vibe-coding" workflow all the way to the finish line.

#### **For the RevenueCat Design Award**

> Our goal for the **RevenueCat Design Award** was to create an experience that feels fluid, responsive, and delightful to use. We focused on several key areas:
>
> * **A Thoughtful Dark Mode:** A hand-tuned dark theme provides a beautiful, comfortable viewing experience that respects the user's preference.
> * **Tactile & Responsive UI:** Subtle haptic feedback is used to confirm key actions, making the app feel tangible and alive in the user's hands.
> * **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** The monetization screen was carefully designed with a card-based layout to guide users to the best value without confusion, turning a simple paywall into a clean and informative part of the experience.
>
> Judges should look for the fluid screen transitions, the satisfying feedback on button presses, and the clean, organized layout of the Account and Store screens.

#### **Additional notes for the judges**

> Thank you for reviewing this project! All premium features are available via the 7-day free trial. We embraced the #BuildInPublic spirit by sharing our progress, struggles, and strategic pivots openly. This transparent process kept us accountable and motivated to deliver the most polished app possible. Special attention was given to monetization clarity and to making every paid feature feel genuinely valuable to end users.


Your drafts are excellent and form a very strong foundation for your submission. After a final review of the official rules, I have some strategic advice and refined text to make your entries as competitive as possible.

The most important advice is to be strategic. You should **not** compete for every award. Focusing your narrative on your strongest categories will make your submission more credible.

***
### Awards to Skip

* **Build & Grow Award:** **SKIP.** The rules require "measurable wins" and "concrete results" like installs, MRR, or other metrics that clearly climbed because of your efforts. As you don't have these post-launch metrics, it's best to skip this.
* **Buzziest Launch Award:** **SKIP.** This award is for "viral social campaigns" and "creative marketing stunts". Your focus has been on building, which is perfect for the #BuildInPublic award, but not this one.
* **RevenueCat Peace Prize:** **STRONGLY RECOMMEND SKIPPING.** The rules state this is for projects with the "greatest social good" that benefit "communities or society at large". Your app is a fun game about deception. Trying to frame it as a tool for global empathy feels inauthentic and could weaken your overall submission. It is better to be honest about what your app is.
* **OneSignal & Kotlin Awards:** **SKIP.** You are not using these technologies.
