**Overall Vibe:** Energetic, polished, and strategically compelling. The music should be modern and upbeat.

#### **Part 1: The Hook - "What is this?" (0:00 - 0:25)**
*Purpose: Immediately grab attention and establish core value. (Perplexity: "Hook judges in the first 20 seconds with the value and uniqueness.")*

* **Shot 1: Title Card (0:00 - 0:03)**
    * **Visuals:** A clean, professional title card with your app's logo, the title **"2Truths-1Lie,"** and the subtitle "A RevenueCat Shipaton 2025 Submission".
    * **Audio:** Upbeat, modern music starts with a subtle "whoosh."
* **Shot 2: Rapid-Fire Polish & Core Value (0:03 - 0:25)**
    * **Visuals:** A quick succession of your app's best moments.
        * A fast-paced scroll through the main challenge feed.
        * The "Correct!" result screen animation playing in full.
        * A clear, quick glimpse of a user laughing/smiling, followed by the app instantly switching from Light to Dark Mode.
        * A close-up on a button with a visual pulse effect to represent the haptic feedback.
        * The "Pro" badge (üïµÔ∏è) appearing next to a username.
    * **Voiceover (VO):** *(Energetic and confident, establishing core value early)* "Welcome to 2 Truths & 1 Lie: the classic social game, now with **video-powered deception and social play!** It‚Äôs a game of creativity, strategy, and pure fun.

#### **Part 2: The Core Loop - "How does it work?" (0:25 - 1:15)**
*Purpose: Clearly demonstrate core gameplay and progression.*

* **Shot 3: Create a Challenge (0:25 - 0:50)**
    * **Visuals:** A clean screen recording. Start on the home screen, showing the user's **score (üèÜ)**. Tap "Create Challenge." Show the "Pro member, unlimited creations!" message. Quickly show the recording of the three video segments.
    * **VO:** "The game is simple: record two true video statements about yourself, and one convincing lie. Your friends and the world will be challenged to spot your deception."
* **Shot 4: Guess a Challenge & Progression (0:50 - 1:15)**
    * **Visuals:** A screen recording of the main feed. The user taps a challenge. The video segments play. The user makes a guess and gets it right. The "Correct!" animation plays, and we see points being awarded. Show the user returning to the home screen, where their score has increased. Show the completed challenge is no longer in the feed.
    * **VO:** "Then, dive into the feed and test your own detective skills. Watch challenges from players around the world and vote on which statement you think is the lie. Correct guesses earn you points and raise your persistent score, and completed challenges disappear from your feed, keeping the content fresh and competitive."

#### **Part 3: The Business - "How does it thrive?" (1:15 - 2:05)**
*Purpose: The centerpiece for the **HAMM Award**. Showcase the full, functional monetization loop and explicitly mention RevenueCat. (Perplexity: "Explicitly mention the RevenueCat SDK in the demo.")*

* **Shot 5: The Paywall & Subscription (1:15 - 1:45)**
    * **Visuals:** Show a free user trying to create too many challenges and hitting the rate limit. They are presented with the polished, hierarchical Store screen. Show a finger tapping the **"Annual (Best Value)"** option, then tapping the main **"Start 7-Day Free Trial"** button. Show the smooth Google Play purchase flow. The user returns to the app, and we see the "Pro" badge (üïµÔ∏è) is now on their profile.
    * **VO:** "2Truths-1Lie uses a robust hybrid freemium model, **powered by the RevenueCat SDK**. Our 'Pro' subscription, accessible via a 7-day free trial, is for our most engaged users. It unlocks valuable perks like **unlimited challenge creation** and a monthly stipend of our virtual currency."
* **Shot 6: Spending Tokens (1:45 - 2:05)**
    * **Visuals:** Show the user playing a challenge. They hesitate, then tap the "Use Hint (ü™ô1)" button. We see a "truth" option get disabled via the 50/50 hint. The user then makes the correct guess.
    * **VO:** "For players who want a competitive edge, consumable 'Tokens' can be purchased and spent on a '50/50' lie-detection hint. This strategy allows players to **pay for meaningful moments of gameplay**, minimizing friction for free users while offering compelling value for subscribers."
