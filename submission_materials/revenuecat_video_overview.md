#### **Part 2: The Core Loop - "How does it work?" (0:20 - 1:15)**

Slow the pace to clearly demonstrate the core gameplay. The music volume drops slightly.

* **Shot 3: Create a Challenge (0:20 - 0:45)**
    * **Visuals:** A clean screen recording. Start on the home screen, showing the user's score (üèÜ). Tap "Create Challenge." Show the screen with the "üïµÔ∏è As a Pro member, you have unlimited challenge creations!" message. Quickly show the recording of the three video segments.
    * **VO:** "The goal is simple: record two true statements about yourself, and one convincing lie. Your friends and the world will be challenged to spot your deception."

* **Shot 4: Guess a Challenge (0:45 - 1:15)**
    * **Visuals:** A screen recording of the main feed. The user taps a challenge. The video segments play. The user makes a guess and gets it right. The "Correct!" animation plays, and we see points being awarded. Show the user returning to the home screen, where their score has increased.
    * **VO:** "Then, dive into the feed and test your own detective skills. Watch challenges from players around the world and vote on which statement you think is the lie. Correct guesses earn you points and raise your score, and completed challenges disappear from your feed to keep the content fresh."
