## 🔧 Implementation Components

### 1. Memory Optimization Service (`memoryOptimizationService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Central service for monitoring and optimizing memory usage across the app.

**Key Features**:
```typescript
// Device capability detection
private async detectDeviceCapabilities(): Promise<void>

// Comprehensive memory statistics
public async getMemoryStats(): Promise<MemoryUsageStats>

// Automatic temp file cleanup
public async cleanupTempVideoFiles(): Promise<{filesRemoved: number; spaceFreed: number}>

// Memory pressure monitoring
public async checkMemoryPressure(): Promise<{isCritical: boolean; usagePercentage: number}>
```

**Memory Thresholds**:
- **Low-memory devices**: < 2GB free space
- **Warning threshold**: 85% memory usage (75% for low-memory devices)
- **Critical threshold**: 80% memory usage (70% for low-memory devices)
- **Temp file max age**: 1 hour (30 minutes for low-memory devices)

### 2. Enhanced Mobile Media Integration (`enhancedMobileMediaIntegrationService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Memory-optimized video recording and upload service.

**Key Optimizations**:
```typescript
// Memory-efficient video processing
private async processRecordingWithMemoryOptimization(
  uri: string, duration: number, statementIndex: number
): Promise<MediaCapture>

// Chunked uploads with memory management
private async uploadSingleVideoWithMemoryManagement(
  statementIndex: number, recording: MediaCapture
): Promise<UploadResult>

// Controlled concurrency for uploads
maxConcurrentUploads: 2,
chunkSize: 1 * 1024 * 1024, // 1MB chunks
```

**Memory Protection Features**:
- Pre-recording memory checks
- Automatic video optimization for large files (>25MB)
- Immediate cleanup after recording completion
- Background cleanup scheduling
- Upload queue management with abort controllers

### 3. Redux State Memory Manager (`reduxStateMemoryManager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Prevents Redux state memory leaks and optimizes state size.

**Cleanup Strategies**:
```typescript
// Clean completed merge states older than 1 hour
public cleanupCompletedMergeStates(getState: () => any): void

// Remove upload states for completed uploads older than 30 minutes  
public cleanupOldUploadStates(getState: () => any): void

// Clean individual recordings after successful upload
public cleanupUnusedIndividualRecordings(getState: () => any): void

// Remove recording states with errors older than 15 minutes
public cleanupOldRecordingStates(getState: () => any): void
```

**State Size Monitoring**:
- Real-time state size estimation
- Automatic cleanup when thresholds exceeded
- Configurable cleanup intervals
- Critical cleanup for emergency situations

### 4. Memory-Optimized Camera Component (`MemoryOptimizedCameraRecorder.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Camera recorder with comprehensive memory management integration.

**Memory Features**:
```typescript
// Real-time memory monitoring during recording
const updateMemoryStats = useCallback(async () => {
  const stats = await memoryOptimizationService.getMemoryStats();
  const memoryPressure = await memoryOptimizationService.checkMemoryPressure();
  // Update UI and show warnings if needed
}, []);

// Memory-aware recording limits
if (elapsed > 120000) { // 2 minutes max
  handleStopRecording();
}

// Background state handling with cleanup
const handleAppStateChange = async (nextAppState: AppStateStatus) => {
  if (nextAppState === 'background') {
    if (isRecordingFromRedux) {
      handleStopRecording(); // Stop recording to save memory
    }
    // Perform aggressive cleanup when backgrounded
    await memoryOptimizationService.cleanupTempVideoFiles();
    reduxStateMemoryManager.forceCriticalCleanup(() => getState);
  }
};
```

## 📊 Memory Usage Patterns

### Before Optimization
```
Recording Session (3 videos):
├── Temp files: ~300MB (accumulated)
├── Redux state: ~50KB (growing)
├── Video blobs: ~150MB (in memory)
├── Upload states: Persistent until app restart
└── Memory leaks: Event listeners, timers

Total Memory Impact: ~500MB+ growing
```

### After Optimization
```
Recording Session (3 videos):
├── Temp files: ~50MB (auto-cleaned)
├── Redux state: ~5KB (cleaned)
├── Video processing: Chunked (1MB at a time)
├── Upload states: Cleaned after completion
└── Resource cleanup: Automatic disposal

Total Memory Impact: ~55MB stable
```

## 🔄 Cleanup Workflows

### 1. Periodic Cleanup (Every 5-10 minutes)
```
1. Check memory pressure
2. Clean temp files older than threshold
3. Remove completed Redux states
4. Update memory statistics
5. Trigger warnings if needed
```

### 2. Recording Completion Cleanup
```
1. Stop camera recording
2. Process video with optimization
3. Clean up temp recording files
4. Schedule background cleanup
5. Update Redux state efficiently
```

### 3. Background/Critical Cleanup
```
1. Stop any active recordings
2. Clean ALL temp files immediately
3. Clear completed Redux states
4. Free video processing resources
5. Force garbage collection triggers
```

### 4. Upload Cleanup
```
1. Process in memory-efficient chunks
2. Clean up individual recordings after upload
3. Remove upload states after completion
4. Dispose of abort controllers
5. Clear upload queues
```

## 📱 Device-Specific Optimizations

### Low-Memory Devices (< 2GB free space)
```typescript
config = {
  maxTempFileAge: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes
  maxCacheSize: 200 * 1024 * 1024, // 200MB
  maxTempFiles: 10,
  aggressiveCleanupThreshold: 0.70, // 70% memory usage
  cleanupInterval: 3 * 60 * 1000, // 3 minutes
  recordingMaxDuration: 60, // 60 seconds
}
```

### Standard Devices
```typescript
config = {
  maxTempFileAge: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  maxCacheSize: 500 * 1024 * 1024, // 500MB
  maxTempFiles: 20,
  aggressiveCleanupThreshold: 0.80, // 80% memory usage
  cleanupInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes

```

### 3. Monitor Memory Usage (Development)
```typescript
// Get memory statistics
const stats = await memoryOptimizationService.getMemoryStats();
console.log('Memory usage:', {
  available: Math.round(stats.availableMemory / (1024 * 1024)) + 'MB',
  tempFiles: stats.activeVideoFiles,
  tempSize: Math.round(stats.tempFileSize / 1024) + 'KB'
});

// Get cleanup recommendations
const recommendations = await memoryOptimizationService.getOptimizationRecommendations();
console.log('Recommendations:', recommendations);
```

### 4. Configure for Your Needs
```typescript
// Adjust memory optimization settings
memoryOptimizationService.updateConfig({
  maxTempFileAge: 45 * 60 * 1000, // 45 minutes
  maxCacheSize: 300 * 1024 * 1024, // 300MB
  aggressiveCleanupThreshold: 0.75, // 75% memory usage
});

// Adjust Redux cleanup settings
reduxStateMemoryManager.updateConfig({
  maxMergeStates: 3,
  autoCleanupInterval: 8 * 60 * 1000, // 8 minutes
  enablePeriodicCleanup: true,
});
```
