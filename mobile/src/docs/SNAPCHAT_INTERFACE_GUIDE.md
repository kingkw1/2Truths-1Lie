# Snapchat-Inspired Guess Challenge Interface

## Overview

This implementation provides a modern, fullscreen, Snapchat-inspired interface for the "Guess Challenge" functionality in the 2Truths-1Lie mobile app. The interface prioritizes immersive video viewing and intuitive gesture-based interaction.

## Key Features

### 🎬 Fullscreen Immersive Experience
- **True fullscreen video display** with no borders, padding, or visual distractions
- **Cinematic black background** for maximum focus on video content
- **Hidden status bar** during gameplay for complete immersion
- **Adaptive video scaling** that works across different device sizes

### 📱 Snapchat-Style Interaction Design
- **Three circular statement selector buttons** positioned at the bottom of the screen
- **Large touch targets** (80px diameter) optimized for thumb interaction
- **Visual hierarchy** with clear statement numbering (1, 2, 3)
- **Intuitive iconography** and modern mobile design language

### 🤏 Gesture-Driven Controls
- **Tap gesture**: Play video for selected statement
- **Long-press gesture**: Auto-submit guess with visual feedback

- **Haptic feedback** for iOS devices (light tap, heavy submission)
- **800ms long-press threshold** for comfortable interaction

### 🎯 Minimal UI Philosophy
- **Clean header** with only essential back navigation
- **No extraneous buttons** or debugging information visible
- **Hidden controls** by default, shown only when needed

- **Contextual instructions** that adapt to game state

### 📲 Modern Mobile UX
- **Bottom-aligned controls** for easy thumb reach
- **Gesture-based interaction** reduces cognitive load
- **Smooth animations** and transitions throughout
- **Responsive design** that works across iOS and Android
- **Accessibility considerations** with proper touch targets

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

#### `SnapchatGuessScreen`
Main fullscreen interface component that orchestrates the entire experience.

**Props:**
- `challenge`: EnhancedChallenge - The challenge data to display
- `onBack`: () => void - Called when user navigates back
- `onComplete?`: () => void - Optional callback for challenge completion

#### `FullscreenVideoPlayer`
Specialized video player optimized for immersive playback without UI clutter.

**Features:**
- Supports both merged videos with segments and individual videos
- Automatic video loading and playback management
- Minimal controls that auto-hide after 3 seconds
- Current statement indicator overlay

#### `useLongPress` Hook
Custom React hook that handles long-press gesture detection with visual feedback.

**Parameters:**
- `callback`: () => void - Function to call on successful long-press
- `delay`: number - Long-press duration threshold (default: 800ms)

**Returns:**
- `isPressed`: boolean - Whether press is currently active
- `startPress`: () => void - Start press handler
- `endPress`: () => void - End press handler  
- `animatedValue`: Animated.Value - Progress animation value

## Integration Guide

### Option 1: GameScreen Integration (Recommended)

```tsx
import { GameScreen } from './src/screens/GameScreen';

const App = () => (
  <GameScreen 
    useSnapchatInterface={true}  // Enable new interface
    hideCreateButton={true}
    onBack={() => navigateToHome()}
  />
);
```

### Option 2: Direct Component Usage

```tsx
import SnapchatGuessScreen from './src/screens/SnapchatGuessScreen';

const ChallengeScreen = ({ challenge }) => (
  <SnapchatGuessScreen
    challenge={challenge}
    onBack={() => navigateBack()}
    onComplete={() => handleCompletion()}
  />
);
```

## User Experience Flow

### Challenge Discovery
1. User selects challenge from list (traditional interface)
2. Challenge loads in fullscreen Snapchat interface
3. Creator name and video placeholder shown initially

### Video Interaction
1. User taps numbered circle (1, 2, or 3) to watch statement
2. Video plays fullscreen with minimal overlay showing "Statement X"
3. User can tap screen to show/hide play controls
4. User can switch between statements by tapping different numbers

### Guess Submission
1. **Quick Tap**: Just plays the video for review
2. **Long Press**: Visual progress ring appears around button
3. **Hold Complete**: Automatic guess submission with haptic feedback
4. **Result Display**: Fullscreen overlay shows correct/incorrect with scoring

### Challenge Completion
1. Results overlay shows final score and reveals the lie
2. "Play Again" button returns to challenge selection
3. Animated feedback celebrates achievements and streaks

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **Redux integration** for challenge data and guess tracking
- **Local state** for UI-specific interactions (video playback, button states)
- **Gesture state** managed through custom hook

### Video Handling
- **Automatic format detection** (merged vs. individual videos)
- **Seamless switching** between statement videos
- **Preloading optimization** for smooth playback
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading** of video components
- **Memoized callbacks** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient animations** using native driver where possible
- **Memory management** for video resources

### Accessibility
- **Large touch targets** (minimum 44px as per iOS guidelines)
- **High contrast** visual indicators
- **Haptic feedback** for users with hearing impairments
- **Screen reader support** for button labels

## Styling Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: `#000000` (True Black)
- **Button Background**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` (Translucent White)
- **Selected State**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)` (More Opaque White)
- **Text Color**: `#ffffff` (Pure White)
- **Progress Ring**: `#ffffff` (White)

### Typography
- **Statement Numbers**: 28px, Bold
- **Instructions**: 16px, Medium Weight
- **Result Text**: 32px, Bold (Success: #34C759, Error: #FF3B30)

### Animations
- **Long Press Progress**: 800ms duration, ease-out
- **Button Scale**: 1.0 to 1.1 on selection
- **Fade Transitions**: 300ms for overlays
- **Haptic Timing**: Synchronized with visual feedback

## Platform Considerations

### iOS Specific
- **Haptic Feedback**: Full implementation with impact styles
- **Safe Area**: Handled automatically with SafeAreaView
- **Status Bar**: Hidden during gameplay, restored on exit

### Android Specific  
- **Navigation Bar**: Proper padding to avoid overlap
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration fallback for older devices
- **Hardware Back**: Handled through back navigation
