# Enhanced Upload UI Implementation

This document describes the robust frontend upload UI implementation that provides comprehensive progress tracking, cancel functionality, retry logic, and error state management.

## Components Overview

### 1. UploadProgressIndicator

An enhanced progress indicator component that shows detailed upload progress with interactive controls.

**Features:**
- Real-time progress tracking with percentage and stage information
- Animated progress bar with smooth transitions
- Bytes uploaded/total display with chunk information
- Estimated time remaining calculation
- Interactive retry and cancel buttons
- Comprehensive error state display with helpful hints
- Platform-specific styling and animations

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { UploadProgressIndicator } from '../components';

<UploadProgressIndicator
  statementIndex={0}
  visible={true}
  onRetry={handleRetry}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
  allowCancel={true}
  allowRetry={true}
/>
```

### 2. EnhancedUploadUI

A comprehensive upload interface that handles the complete upload workflow.

**Features:**
- Full upload lifecycle management
- Modal and inline display modes
- Auto-start capability
- Comprehensive error handling with retry limits
- Success/failure feedback with detailed information
- Configurable retry attempts and error recovery
- Integration with Redux state management

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { EnhancedUploadUI } from '../components';

<EnhancedUploadUI
  statementIndex={0}
  videoUri="file://video.mp4"
  filename="video.mp4"
  duration={5000}
  onUploadComplete={handleComplete}
  onUploadError={handleError}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
  autoStart={false}
  showModal={true}
/>
```

### 3. useUploadManager Hook

A custom hook that manages upload state, retry logic, and error handling.

**Features:**
- Centralized upload state management
- Automatic retry logic for recoverable errors
- Configurable retry limits and delays
- Error categorization and handling
- Integration with Redux store
- Upload cancellation and cleanup

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { useUploadManager } from '../hooks/useUploadManager';

const uploadManager = useUploadManager(statementIndex, {
  maxRetries: 3,
  autoRetryDelay: 2000,
  compressionQuality: 0.8,
  maxFileSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024,
});

// Start upload
const result = await uploadManager.startUpload(videoUri, filename, duration);

// Retry upload
await uploadManager.retryUpload(videoUri, filename, duration);

// Cancel upload
uploadManager.cancelUpload();
```

## Upload States

The upload UI handles the following states:

### Progress States
- **Preparing**: Initial file validation and setup
- **Compressing**: Video compression (if enabled)
- **Uploading**: File upload with chunk progress
- **Finalizing**: Upload completion and URL generation

### Error States
- **Network Errors**: Connection failures, timeouts
- **Permission Errors**: Access denied, authentication failures
- **Storage Errors**: Insufficient space, file system errors
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid file format, size limits
- **Server Errors**: Backend failures, service unavailable

### Interactive States
- **Retry Available**: User can retry failed uploads
- **Cancel Available**: User can cancel active uploads
- **Auto-retry**: Automatic retry for recoverable errors
- **Max Retries Reached**: Final error state with manual recovery options

## Error Handling

### Error Categorization

The system categorizes errors into recoverable and non-recoverable types:

**Auto-Retry Errors:**
- Network connection failures
- Server timeouts
- Temporary server errors (503, 502)

**Manual Retry Errors:**
- File validation failures
- Permission errors
- Storage space issues

### Error Messages

User-friendly error messages are provided for common scenarios:

- Network issues: "Network connection failed. Please check your internet connection."
- Storage issues: "Insufficient storage space. Please free up some space and try again."
- Permission issues: "Permission denied. Please check your app permissions."
- File issues: "Video file not found. Please record again."

## Redux Integration

The upload UI integrates with Redux for state management:

### Actions
- `startUpload`: Initialize upload session
- `updateUploadProgress`: Update progress percentage
- `setUploadState`: Update detailed upload state
- `completeUpload`: Mark upload as complete
- `setUploadError`: Set error state
- `cancelUpload`: Cancel active upload

### State Structure
```typescript
uploadState: {
  [statementIndex: number]: {
    isUploading: boolean;
    uploadProgress: number;
    uploadError: string | null;
    sessionId: string | null;
    bytesUploaded?: number;
    totalBytes?: number;
    currentChunk?: number;
    totalChunks?: number;
    startTime?: number;
  };
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Upload Service Options
```typescript
{
  compress: boolean;              // Enable video compression
  compressionQuality: number;     // Compression quality (0-1)
  maxFileSize: number;           // Maximum file size in bytes
  chunkSize: number;             // Upload chunk size
  retryAttempts: number;         // Internal retry attempts per chunk
  timeout: number;               // Upload timeout in milliseconds
}
```

### Upload Manager Options
```typescript
{
  maxRetries: number;            // Maximum retry attempts
  autoRetryDelay: number;        // Delay between auto-retries
  compressionQuality: number;    // Video compression quality
  maxFileSize: number;          // Maximum allowed file size
}
```

## Accessibility Features

- Screen reader support with descriptive labels
- High contrast error states
- Large touch targets for interactive elements
- Clear visual feedback for all states
