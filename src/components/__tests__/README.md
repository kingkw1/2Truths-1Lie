## Key Testing Areas Covered

### Recording Functionality
- ✅ Video recording with full controls (start, pause, resume, cancel)
- ✅ Audio recording with device selection
- ✅ Text recording with validation and character limits
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms when media APIs unavailable
- ✅ Permission handling and graceful degradation

### Preview and Playback
- ✅ Video preview with custom controls
- ✅ Audio preview with visualizer
- ✅ Text preview with formatting
- ✅ Re-recording and confirmation workflows
- ✅ Media element error handling

### Compression Pipeline
- ✅ Client-side media compression
- ✅ Progress reporting during compression
- ✅ Compression error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Quality settings and optimization
- ✅ Metadata preservation

### Upload System
- ✅ Chunked upload with resumable support
- ✅ Progress tracking with speed/ETA calculations
- ✅ Error handling with exponential backoff retry
- ✅ Network failure recovery
- ✅ Authentication and security
- ✅ Concurrent upload handling

### Failure Modes
- ✅ Network connectivity issues
- ✅ Server errors (4xx, 5xx)
- ✅ Permission denied scenarios
- ✅ Device not found errors
- ✅ Corrupted media handling
- ✅ Session expiration
- ✅ Resource exhaustion

### Performance
- ✅ Large file handling (GB+ files)
- ✅ Memory usage optimization
- ✅ UI responsiveness during operations
- ✅ Concurrent operation handling
- ✅ Resource cleanup and leak prevention

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- ✅ MediaRecorder API availability checks

- Performance measurement helpers

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern=MediaWorkflow
npm test -- --testPathPattern=MediaFailureModes
npm test -- --testPathPattern=MediaPerformance

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all media-related functionality
- **Reliability**: Tests handle async operations and timing correctly
- **Performance**: Tests validate performance characteristics
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured with clear test organization
- **Real-world scenarios**: Tests cover actual user workflows and edge cases

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments with:
- Headless browser support
- Deterministic timing
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Clear failure reporting
- Performance regression detection
