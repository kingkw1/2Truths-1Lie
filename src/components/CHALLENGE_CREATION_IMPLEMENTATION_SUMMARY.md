## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/components/ChallengeCreationForm.tsx` - Main form component
- `src/components/ChallengeCreationDemo.tsx` - Demo wrapper
- `src/components/__tests__/ChallengeCreationForm.test.tsx` - Full test suite
- `src/components/__tests__/ChallengeCreationForm.basic.test.tsx` - Basic functionality tests

### Modified Files:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added ChallengeCreationDemo to main app
- `src/setupTests.ts` - Added testing library imports
- `.kiro/specs/core-gameplay-flow/tasks.md` - Updated task status

## Integration Points

### Redux Integration
- Uses existing `challengeCreationSlice` for state management
- Dispatches actions for statement updates and lie selection
- Handles validation and preview mode states

### Type Safety
