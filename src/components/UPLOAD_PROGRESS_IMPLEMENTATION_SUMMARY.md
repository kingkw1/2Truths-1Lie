# Upload Progress Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the UploadProgress component with real-time upload progress tracking and cancel functionality, integrating with the existing chunked upload backend API.

## Components Implemented

### 1. UploadProgress Component (`src/components/UploadProgress.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Real-time progress tracking with percentage and visual progress bar
- Upload speed calculation (bytes/second)
- Estimated time remaining (ETA)
- Cancel upload functionality with backend integration
- Retry failed uploads
- File size formatting (B, KB, MB, GB)
- Compact and detailed display modes
- Chunk-level progress tracking
- Error handling and user-friendly messages

**Props:**
- `sessionId`: Upload session identifier
- `filename`: Name of file being uploaded
- `fileSize`: Total file size in bytes
- `onUploadComplete`: Callback when upload finishes
- `onUploadError`: Callback for upload errors
- `onUploadCancel`: Callback when user cancels
- `autoStart`: Whether to start monitoring automatically
- `showDetails`: Show detailed progress information
- `compact`: Use compact display mode

### 2. ChunkedUploadService (`src/services/uploadService.ts`)

**Features:**
- File chunking and parallel upload support
- SHA-256 hash calculation for integrity verification
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Progress callbacks for real-time updates
- Upload cancellation support
- Resume interrupted uploads
- Authentication token handling

**Key Methods:**
- `initiateUpload()`: Start new upload session
- `uploadFile()`: Upload file with progress tracking
- `cancelUpload()`: Cancel active upload
- `getUploadStatus()`: Check upload progress
- `resumeUpload()`: Resume interrupted upload

### 3. useFileUpload Hook (`src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts`)

**Features:**
- React hook for easy upload integration
- State management for upload progress
- Automatic cleanup on unmount
- Error handling and retry logic
- Cancel and resume functionality

**Returns:**
- Upload state (progress, error, result)
- Control functions (start, cancel, retry, reset)
- Computed values (progress percent, speed, ETA)

### 4. Demo Components

**MediaUploadDemo** (`src/components/MediaUploadDemo.tsx`):
- Complete workflow from recording to upload
- Integration with MediaRecorder component
- Upload queue management
- Completed uploads tracking

**UploadProgressExample** (`src/components/UploadProgressExample.tsx`):
- Simple file upload example
- Basic integration pattern
- Multiple upload session tracking

## Integration Points

### Backend API Integration

The components integrate with the existing chunked upload API:

- `POST /api/v1/upload/initiate` - Start upload session
- `POST /api/v1/upload/{sessionId}/chunk/{chunkNumber}` - Upload chunk
- `POST /api/v1/upload/{sessionId}/complete` - Complete upload
- `GET /api/v1/upload/{sessionId}/status` - Check progress
- `DELETE /api/v1/upload/{sessionId}` - Cancel upload

### MediaRecorder Integration

The UploadProgress component works seamlessly with the existing MediaRecorder:

1. User records media using MediaRecorder
2. MediaRecorder completes and provides MediaCapture data
3. MediaUploadDemo converts MediaCapture to File
4. ChunkedUploadService handles the upload with progress tracking
5. UploadProgress shows real-time progress and controls

## Key Features Implemented

### Real-time Progress Tracking
- Polls backend every second for upload status
- Calculates upload speed based on elapsed time
- Estimates time remaining based on current speed
- Updates progress bar and percentage display

### Upload Controls
- **Cancel**: Stops upload and cleans up server-side session
- **Retry**: Restarts failed uploads from beginning
- **Dismiss**: Hides completed/cancelled uploads

### Error Handling
- Network error recovery with automatic retries
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation when backend is unavailable
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient polling with abort controllers
- Memory cleanup for blob URLs
- Minimal re-renders with optimized state updates
- Configurable chunk sizes for optimal performance

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites implemented:

### UploadProgress Component Tests (`src/components/__tests__/UploadProgress.test.tsx`)
- Initial rendering and props handling
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Upload control actions (cancel, retry, dismiss)
- Speed and ETA calculations
- Error handling scenarios
- File size formatting
- Detailed vs compact modes

### Upload Service Tests (`src/services/__tests__/uploadService.test.ts`)
- Upload session initiation
- File chunking and upload
- Progress callbacks
- Error handling and retries
- Upload cancellation
- Hash calculation
- Authentication handling

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```tsx
<UploadProgress
  sessionId="upload-123"
  filename="video.mp4"
  fileSize={1024 * 1024 * 10} // 10MB
  onUploadComplete={(fileUrl) => console.log('Done:', fileUrl)}
  onUploadError={(error) => console.error('Error:', error)}
  onUploadCancel={() => console.log('Cancelled')}
/>
```

### With useFileUpload Hook
```tsx
const { startUpload, progress, sessionId } = useFileUpload({
  onUploadComplete: (result) => console.log('Upload complete:', result),
});

// Start upload
await startUpload(file);

// Show progress
{progress && sessionId && (
  <UploadProgress
    sessionId={sessionId}
    filename={file.name}
    fileSize={file.size}
  />
)}
```

### Integration with MediaRecorder
```tsx
<MediaRecorder
  onRecordingComplete={async (mediaData) => {
    const file = await convertMediaToFile(mediaData);
    await startUpload(file);
  }}
/>

{isUploading && (
  <UploadProgress
    sessionId={sessionId}
    filename={filename}
    fileSize={fileSize}
  />
)}
```
