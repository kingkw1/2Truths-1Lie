# Enhanced Media Recorder Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: Implement video and audio recording components with full controls (start, pause, resume, cancel)

### Overview
Successfully enhanced the existing MediaRecorder component to provide comprehensive recording controls including start, pause, resume, and cancel functionality for both video and audio recording modes.

### Key Enhancements Made

#### 1. Enhanced Control Interface
- **Start Recording**: Initiates recording for selected media type (video/audio/text)
- **Pause/Resume**: Allows pausing and resuming active recordings with visual feedback
- **Stop & Save**: Completes recording and saves the media data
- **Cancel**: Stops recording without saving, with user confirmation feedback

#### 2. Improved User Experience
- **Visual State Indicators**: Clear button states showing current recording status
- **Tooltips**: Helpful tooltips explaining each control's function
- **Color-coded Buttons**: 
  - Red for record/cancel
  - Orange for pause
  - Green for resume
  - Gray for stop
- **Real-time Duration Display**: Shows current recording time vs. maximum allowed

#### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Automatically falls back to text mode when media recording fails
- **User-friendly Messages**: Clear error messages and recovery instructions
- **Permission Handling**: Proper handling of media device permissions

#### 4. Technical Improvements

##### MediaRecorder Component (`src/components/MediaRecorder.tsx`)
- Added `cancelRecording()` method that stops recording without triggering save
- Enhanced control button layout with proper state management
- Improved visual feedback for recording states
- Added tooltips and accessibility attributes

##### useMediaRecording Hook (`src/hooks/useMediaRecording.ts`)
- Added `cancelRecording()` method to the hook interface
- Enhanced state management for pause/resume functionality
- Improved cleanup and error handling

#### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Enhanced existing tests in `MediaRecorder.test.tsx`
- **Integration Tests**: New comprehensive test suite in `MediaRecorder.integration.test.tsx`
- **Demo Component**: Created `EnhancedMediaRecorderDemo.tsx` for testing and demonstration
